Description
-----------

This function creates spline using the set of points and interpolates
the input between them.

First and second derivatives from the spline can be calculated by using
the derivative1D function.

BSpline function takes a set of attributes and a set of parameters. The
first attrbiute is 'n' which has integer type and sets the number of
interpolation points. The parameter names have the form 'yi' where 'y'
is letter 'y' and 'i' is the parameter's index starting from 0 and have
the type double. Likewise, the attribute names have the form 'xi'.
