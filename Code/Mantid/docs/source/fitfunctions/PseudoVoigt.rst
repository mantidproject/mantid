Description
-----------

The Pseudo-Voigt function is an approximation for the Voigt function, which is a convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian function. It is often used as a peak profile in powder diffraction for cases where neither a pure Gaussian or Lorentzian function appropriately describe a peak.

Instead of convoluting those two functions, the Pseudo-Voigt function is defined as the sum of a Gaussian peak :math:`G(x)` and a Lorentzian peak :math:`L(x)`, weighted by a fourth parameter :math:`\eta` (values between 0 and 1) which shifts the profile more towards pure Gaussian or pure Lorentzian when approaching 1 or 0 respectively:

.. math:: PV(x) = \eta G(x) + (1 - \eta)L(x)

Both functions share three parameters: Height (height of the peak at the maximum), PeakCentre (position of the maximum) and FWHM (full width at half maximum of the peak).

The figure below shows data together with a fitted Pseudo-Voigt function, as well as Gaussian and Lorentzian with equal parameters. The mixing parameter for that example is 0.7, which means that the function is behaving more like a Gaussian.
