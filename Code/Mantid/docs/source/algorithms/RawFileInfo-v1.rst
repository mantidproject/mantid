Description
-----------

Extracts run parameters from the `RAW <RAW_File>`__ file given as an
input property. If the *GetRunParameters* argument is *True* then a
TableWorkspace is created that contains a column for each value of the
RPB\_STRUCT, i.e. column names such as r\_dur, r\_goodfrm etc. This is
Mantid's version of the **Get** routine in Open Genie.
