Description
-----------

Simulate a USANS workspace.

A matrix workspace is created for a given analyzer angle. A list of
wavelength peaks coming out of the monochromator can be specified. The
width of those peaks can also be specified.

Both the main detector and the transmission detector are filled with
compatible signals according to a dummy transmission curve.

The amplitude of the signal in the main detector is given by a sphere
model.

A monitor workspace is created with a fake beam profile.
