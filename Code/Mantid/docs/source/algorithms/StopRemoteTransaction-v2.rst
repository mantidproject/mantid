Description
-----------

Stop a transaction on a (remote) compute resource. The transaction
must have been created previously with
:ref:`algm-StartRemoteTransaction`.

For more details on remote algorithms when using the Mantid web
service remote job submission API, see the `remote job submission API
docs <http://www.mantidproject.org/Remote_Job_Submission_API>`_.

Previous Versions
-----------------

Version 1
#########

Version 1 stops transactions using the Stop action of the `Mantid
remote job submission API
<http://www.mantidproject.org/Remote_Job_Submission_API>`_. This is
still supported as one of the variants of Versions 2 and above, when
the compute resource uses the Mantid remote job submission API as job
manager (underlying remote job scheduling mechanism).
