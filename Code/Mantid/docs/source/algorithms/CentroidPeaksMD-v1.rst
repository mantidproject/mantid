Description
-----------

This algorithm starts with a PeaksWorkspace containing the expected
positions of peaks in reciprocal space. It calculates the centroid of
the peak by calculating the average of the coordinates of all events
within a given radius of the peak, weighted by the weight (signal) of
the event.
