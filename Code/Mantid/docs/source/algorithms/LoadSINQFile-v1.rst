LoadSINQFile is a wrapper algorithm around LoadFlexiNexus. It locates a
suitable dictionary file for the instrument in question and then goes
away to call LoadFlexiNexus with the right arguments. It also performs
any other magic which might be required to get the data in the right
shape for further processing in Mantid.
