Description
-----------

Given a :ref:`PeaksWorkspace <PeaksWorkspace>` and a set of lattice parameters,
attempts to tag each peak with a HKL value by comparing d-spacings between
potential HKL matches and the peaks as well as angles between Q vectors.

Usage Notes
-----------

This algorithm does not generate a UB Matrix, it will only index peaks.
Run :ref:`CalculateUMatrix <algm-CalculateUMatrix>` algorithm after executing
this algorithm in order to attach a UB Matrix onto the sample. The
:ref:`CopySample <algm-CopySample>` algorithm will allow this UB Matrix to be
transfered between workspaces.

Usage
-----

.. warning::

    This algorithm is deprecated and should no longer be used. One should consider using
    :ref:`FindPeaksMD <algm-FindPeaksMD>`
