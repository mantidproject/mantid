Description
-----------

Compute the cross correlation function for a range of spectra with
respect to a reference spectrum.

This is use in powder diffraction experiments when trying to estimate
the offset of one spectra with respect to another one. The spectra are
converted in d-spacing and then interpolate on the X-axis of the
reference. The cross correlation function is computed in the range
[-N/2,N/2] where N is the number of points.
