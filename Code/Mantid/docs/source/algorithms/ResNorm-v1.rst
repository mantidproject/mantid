Description
-----------

The routine varies the width of the resolution file to give a 'stretch
factor' and the area provides an intensity normalisation factor. The
fitted parameters are in the group workspace with suffix \_ResNorm with
additional suffices of Intensity & Stretch. The fitted data are in the
workspace ending in \_ResNorm\_Fit.

This routine was originally part of the MODES package.
