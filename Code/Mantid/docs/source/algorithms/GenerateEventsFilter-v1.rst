Description
-----------

This algorithm is able to generate event splitters according to user's
requirement for filtering events. The generated time splitters are
stored either in a `SplittersWorkspace <SplittersWorkspace>`__ or a
`MatrixWorkspace <MatrixWorkspace>`__. Both of them will be used by
algorithm :ref:`algm-FilterEvents` to filter events from an
`EventWorkspace <EventWorkspace>`__.

This algorithm is designed as a general-purposed event splitter
generator. Combined with :ref:`algm-FilterEvents`, it will
replace

-  :ref:`algm-FilterByTime`
-  :ref:`algm-FilterByLogValue`

Moreover, the time resolution of these two algorithms is microseconds,
i.e., the wall time of an (neutron) event. While the original
:ref:`algm-FilterByTime` and
:ref:`algm-FilterByLogValue` are of the resolution of pulse
time. It is also enhanced to process the fast frequency sample logs,
which can be even faster than chopper frequencies.

Workspace to store event splitters
##################################

An event splitter used in Mantid contains start time, stop time and
target workspace. Any data structure that has the above 3 properties can
serve as event splitter. There are 2 types of output workspaces storing
event splitters that are supported by this algorithm.

-  `SplittersWorkspace <SplittersWorkspace>`__: It is a
   `TableWorskpace <TableWorskpace>`__ that has 3 columns for start
   time, stop time and target workspace for events within start time and
   stop time. This type of workspace is appropriate for the case that
   the amount of generated event splitters are not huge;
-  `MatrixWorkspace <MatrixWorkspace>`__: It uses X-axis to store time
   stamp in total nanoseconds and Y-axis to store target workspace. For
   example, x\_i, x\_i+1 and y\_i construct an event filter as start
   time is x\_i, stop time is x\_i+i, and target workspace is y\_i-th
   workspace. If y\_i is less than 0, then it means that all events
   between time x\_i and x\_i+1 will be discarded. This type of
   workspace is appropriate for the case that the amount of generated
   event splitters are huge, because processing a
   `MatrixWorkspace <MatrixWorkspace>`__ is way faster than a
   `TableWorkspace <TableWorkspace>`__ in Mantid.

Functionalities
###############

Here are the types of event filters (i.e.,
`SplittersWorkspace <SplittersWorkspace>`__) that can be generated by
this algorithm:

-  A filter for one time interval.

-  A series of filters for multiple continuous time intervals, which
   have the same length of period. Each of them has an individual
   workspace index associated. These workspace indices are incremented
   by 1 from 0 along with their orders in time.

-  A filter containing one or multiple time intervals according to a
   specified log value. Any log value of the time that falls into the
   selected time intervals is equal or within the tolerance of a user
   specified value.

-  A series filters containing one or multiple time intervals according
   to specified log values incremented by a constant value. Any log
   value of the time that falls into the selected time intervals is
   equal or within the tolerance of the log value as v\_0 + n x delta\_v
   +/- tolerance\_v.

Parameter: *Centre*
###################

The input Boolean parameter *centre* is for filtering by log value(s).
If option *centre* is taken, then for each interval,

-  starting time = log\_time - tolerance\_time;
-  stopping time = log\_time - tolerance\_time;

It is a shift to left.

Parameter: *LogValueTolerance* and *LogValueInterval*
#####################################################

These two parameters are used to determine the log value intervals for
filtering events.

Let user-specified minimum log value to be 'min', LogValueTolerance to
be 'tol', and LogValueInterval to be 'delta', then the log value
intervals are (min-tol, min-tol+delta), (min-tol+delta, min-tol+2delta),
...

The default value of LogValueTolerance is LogValueInterval devided by 2.

About how log value is recorded
###############################

SNS DAS records log values upon its changing. The frequency of log
sampling is significantly faster than change of the log, i.e., sample
environment devices. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that all the
log value changes as step functions.

The option to do interpolation is not supported at this moment.

Comparison to FilterByLogValue
##############################

1. If the first log value is within the specified range and the first
log time is after run star time, FilterByLogValue assumes that the log
value before the first recorded log time is also within range, and thus
the first splitter starts from the run star time, while
GenerateEventFilter tends to be more conservative, and thus the first
splitter will start from the first log time.

2. FilterByLogValue only filters events at the resolution of pulse time,
while :ref:`algm-GenerateEventsFilter` can improve the
resolution to 1 micro second.
