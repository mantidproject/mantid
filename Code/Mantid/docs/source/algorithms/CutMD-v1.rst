Description
-----------

This algorithm performs slicing of multiDimensional data according to a chosen
projection, and binning choice. The algorithm uses :ref:`algm-BinMD` or
:ref:`algm-SliceMD` to achieve the binning of the data. The choice of child
algorithm used for the slicing is controlled by the NoPix option.

The synax is similar to that used by `Horace <http://horace.isis.rl.ac.uk/Manipulating_and_extracting_data_from_SQW_files_and_objects#cut_sqw>`__.

Unlike most Mantid algorithms, CutMD can accept a list of workspaces as the
input workspace, given as the name of a workspace in the analysis data service
or the path to a workspace, or simply a workspace object in python. These will
all then be processed sequentially with the same options. The only requirement
is that the same number of output workspaces are also given so that CutMD knows
what to call each output workspace created.

Usage
-----

**Example - Contrived example using projections:**

.. testcode:: Example4D

   from mantid.api import Projection

   to_cut = CreateMDWorkspace(Dimensions=4, Extents=[-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-10,10], Names="H,K,L,E", Units="U,U,U,V")
   # Add two fake peaks so that we can see the effect of the basis transformation

   FakeMDEventData(InputWorkspace='to_cut', PeakParams=[10000,-0.5,0,0,0,0.1])

   FakeMDEventData(InputWorkspace='to_cut', PeakParams=[10000,0.5,0,0,0,0.1])
    
   SetUB(Workspace=to_cut, a=1, b=1, c=1, alpha=90, beta=90, gamma=90)
   SetSpecialCoordinates(InputWorkspace=to_cut, SpecialCoordinates='HKL')

   #Since we only specify u and v, w is automatically calculated to be the cross product of u and v
   projection = Projection([1,1,0], [-1,1,0])
   proj_ws = projection.createWorkspace()
   
   # Apply the cut (PBins property sets the P1Bin, P2Bin, etc. properties for you)
   out_md = CutMD(to_cut, Projection=proj_ws, PBins=([0.1], [0.1], [0.1], [-5,5]), NoPix=True)

   #Another way we can call CutMD:
   #[out1, out2, out3] = CutMD([to_cut, "some_other_file.nxs", "some_workspace_name"], ...)

   print 'number of dimensions', out_md.getNumDims()
   print 'number of dimensions not integrated', len(out_md.getNonIntegratedDimensions())
   dim_dE = out_md.getDimension(3)
   print 'min dE', dim_dE.getMaximum()
   print 'max dE', dim_dE.getMinimum()

Output:

.. testoutput:: Example4D

   number of dimensions 4
   number of dimensions not integrated 3
   min dE 5.0
   max dE -5.0
