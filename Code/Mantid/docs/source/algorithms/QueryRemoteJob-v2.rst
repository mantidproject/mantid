Description
-----------

Query information for a particular job (identified by its ID)
submitted to the (remote) compute resource given in the
properties. Jobs are submitted with :ref:`algm-SubmitRemoteJob`.

For specific details on remote algorithms when using the Mantid web
service remote job submission API, see the `remote job submission API
docs <http://www.mantidproject.org/Remote_Job_Submission_API>`_.

Previous Versions
-----------------

Version 1
#########

Version 1 queries the status of jobs using the `Mantid remote job
submission API
<http://www.mantidproject.org/Remote_Job_Submission_API>`_. This is
still supported as one of the variants of Versions 2 and above, when
the compute resource uses the Mantid remote job submission API as job
manager (underlying remote job scheduling mechanism).
