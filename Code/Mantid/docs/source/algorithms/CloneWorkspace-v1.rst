Description
-----------

This algorithm performs a deep copy of all of the information in the
workspace. It maintains events if the input is an
`EventWorkspace <EventWorkspace>`__. It will call CloneMDWorkspace for a
`MDEventWorkspace <MDEventWorkspace>`__ or a
`MDHistoWorkspace <MDHistoWorkspace>`__. It can also clone a
`PeaksWorkspace <PeaksWorkspace>`__.
