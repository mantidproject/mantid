Description
-----------

Reads a McStas NeXus file into a Mantid WorkspaceGroup with a
user-supplied name. Data generated by McStas monitor components are
stored in workspaces of type :ref:`Workspace2D <Workspace2D>`. All data
sets are numbered and nested within the WorkspaceGroup. This algorithm
is under development. To date it has been tested with the following
instrument files from the McStas 2.0 instrument suite: templateDIFF,
templateLaue, templateTAS, Reflectometer, Test\_Pol\_TripleAxis,
TestSANS and Tomography. For more information about McStas and its
general usage for simulating neutron scattering instruments and
experiments visit the McStas homepage http://www.mcstas.org.
