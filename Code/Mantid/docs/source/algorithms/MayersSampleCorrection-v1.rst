Description
-----------

Calculates and applies corrections due to the effects of absorption, and optionally multiple scattering,
to the signal and error values for a given workspace. The full background to the algorithm is described
by Lindley et al. [1]_ and is briefly described here.

The aim is to correct the number of neutrons detected at a given detector (:math:`N_d`) to compute the
number of incident neutrons (:math:`N_0`):

.. math::

   N_d = \frac{N_0 nV}{A_s} \frac{\sigma_s}{4\pi} \frac{\eta\Delta\Omega}{1-\beta}

where :math:`n` is the sample number density, :math:`V` is the sample volume, :math:`A_s` is the self-shielding factor,
:math:`\sigma_s` is the scattering cross section, :math:`\eta` is the detector efficiency, :math:`\Delta\Omega` is the solid
angle and :math:`\beta` is the ratio of twice to once scattered intensity.

The following assumptions are made:

* the sample shape is a cylinder
* for multiple scattering:
   * the scattering is assumed to be elastic and isotropic
   * the ratio of successive orders of scattering are equal.

The input time of flight range combined with the cylinder radius (:math:`r`) and scattering cross-sections gives a range
of :math:`\mu r` for the cylinder, where :math:`\mu` is the inverse attenutation length. The :math:`\mu r` range is divided
in to a discrete number of points for each point:

* the attentuation factor is computed by numerical integration over the sample cylinder
* the multiple scattering factor (if requested) is computed by simulating over a fixed number of second order scattering events
  and computing the ratio of second order and first order scattering.

A weighted least-squares fit is applied to both the set of attenuation and multiple scattering factors to allow interpolation of the
correction factor from any time-of-flight value in the input range. For each time-of-flight value the factor is computed from the fit
coefficients and the correction applied multiplicatively:

.. math::

   \begin{aligned}
   y_{out} &= y_{in} * corrfact \\
   e_{out} &= y_{out} * e_{in} / y_{in}
   \end{aligned}

The above procedure is repeated separately for each spectrum in the workspace.

                                     XMin=1000,XMax=10000)

   cyl_height_cm = 4
   cyl_radius_cm = 0.25
   cylinder_sample(sample_ws, cyl_radius_cm, cyl_height_cm)

   # Vanadium material
   material = 'V'
   num_density = 0.07261
   SetSampleMaterial(sample_ws, ChemicalFormula=material,
                     SampleNumberDensity=num_density)

   # Run corrections
   corrected_sample = MayersSampleCorrection(sample_ws,
                                             MultipleScattering=True)

   # Print a bin
   print "Uncorrected signal: {0:.4f}".format(sample_ws.readY(0)[25])
   print "Corrected signal: {0:.4f}".format(corrected_sample.readY(0)[25])

Output:

.. testoutput:: WithMultipleScattering

   Uncorrected signal: 0.0556
   Corrected signal: 0.0120
