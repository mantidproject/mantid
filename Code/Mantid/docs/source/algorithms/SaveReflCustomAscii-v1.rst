Description
-----------

This is a custom save method as there is the ability to customise the headers, including adding log lists and subtitles as required.
The workspace data are stored in the file in columns: the first column
contains the X-values, followed by pairs of Y and E values. There is an optional fourth column of Delta Q values. Columns are
separated by spaces. This is used by the reflectometry interface.
