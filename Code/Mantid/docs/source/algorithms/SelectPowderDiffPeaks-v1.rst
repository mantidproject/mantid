Description
-----------

Select the powder diffraction peaks for `Le Bail Fit <Le Bail Fit>`__ 
by the Z-score of the peak parameters. 
The peak with parameters that are very different from the others will be removed
from the list of peaks to do Le Bail Fit. 

This algorithm was implemented as a prototype to calibate powder diffractomter's peak profile.
It is deprecated because algorithm FitPowderDiffPeaks, which contains the similar functionality,
has been implemented.  

There won't be any usage example for SelectPowderDiffPeaks because it is deprecated.
