Description
-----------

Sort a peaks workspace by a single column. Sorting of that
PeaksWorkspace by that column can either happen in an ascending or
descending fashion. The algorithm can either be used to generate a new
OutputWorkspace, which is sorted as requested, or to perform an in-place
sort of the InputWorkspace.
