Description
-----------

Sets the neutrons information in the sample. You can either enter
details about the chemical formula or atomic number, or you can provide
specific values for the attenuation and scattering cross sections and
the sample number density. If you decide to provide specific values you
must give values for all three (attenuation and scattering cross
sections and the sample number density), and any formula information
will be ignored. If you miss any of the three specific values then the
other will be ignored.

Neutron scattering lengths and cross sections of the elements and their
isotopes have been taken from
`1 <http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/n-lengths/list.html>`__.
