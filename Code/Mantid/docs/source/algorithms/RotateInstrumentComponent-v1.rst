Description
-----------

RotateInstrumentComponent rotates a component around an axis of rotation
by an angle given in degrees. Rotation by 0 degrees does not change the
component's orientation. The rotation axis (X,Y,Z) must be given in the
co-ordinate system attached to the component and rotates with it.

Usage
-----

Example 1: rotating a bank
##########################

.. testcode:: ExBank

  # Load a MUSR file
  musr = Load('MUSR00015189')
  # and use the first workspace in the workspace group
  ws = mtd['musr_1']

  print 'Original positions of detectors 1 and 2'
  print 'Det 1',ws.getInstrument().getDetector(1).getPos()
  print 'Det 2',ws.getInstrument().getDetector(2).getPos()

  # Rotate bank 'back' around the Z axis by 360 / 32 degrees.
  RotateInstrumentComponent( ws, ComponentName='back', X=0,Y=0,Z=1, Angle=360.0 / 32 )

  print 'Positions of detectors 1 and 2 after rotation'
  print 'Det 1',ws.getInstrument().getDetector(1).getPos()
  print 'Det 2',ws.getInstrument().getDetector(2).getPos()
  print 'Detector 1 took place of detector 2'

Output
^^^^^^

.. testoutput:: ExBank

  Original positions of detectors 1 and 2
  Det 1 [-0.0888151,-0.108221,0.145]
  Det 2 [-0.0659955,-0.123469,0.145]
  Positions of detectors 1 and 2 after rotation
  Det 1 [-0.0659955,-0.123469,0.145]
  Det 2 [-0.0406399,-0.133972,0.145]
  Detector 1 took place of detector 2

Example 2: rotating a detector
##############################

.. testcode:: ExDet

  import numpy as np

  # Load a MUSR file
  musr = Load('MUSR00015189')
  # and use the first workspace in the workspace group
  ws = mtd['musr_1']

  # Rotating a detector doesn't change its position, just its orientation

  # Original position of detector 33
  print ws.getInstrument().getDetector(33).getPos()

  # Caclulate the solid angles for all detectors in the instrument
  # The result is a single-bin workspace with solid angles for all spectra in ws
  saws = SolidAngle( ws )
  # Collect the solid angles from the first bin in saws and save them in numpy array.
  # Numpy module makes it easy to manipulate arrays
  sa1 = np.array( [ saws.readY(i)[0] for i in range(saws.getNumberHistograms()) ] )

  # Rotate detector 33 around the Z axis by 90 degrees.
  RotateInstrumentComponent( ws, DetectorID=33, X=0,Y=0,Z=1, Angle=90 )

  # Check the position of detector 33 stays unchanged
  print ws.getInstrument().getDetector(33).getPos()

  # Calculate the solid angles after rotation
  saws = SolidAngle( ws )
  sa2 = np.array( [ saws.readY(i)[0] for i in range(saws.getNumberHistograms()) ] )

  # Take element by element difference of the solid angles
  diff = sa2 - sa1
  print diff
  print 'The non-zero difference',diff[32] ,'is due to detector', ws.getDetector(32).getID()
