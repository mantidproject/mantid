Description
-----------

This algorithm allows a single spectrum to be extracted from a range of
workspaces and placed into a single workspace for comparison and
plotting. The LabelUsing property allows you to control what the end
labels applied to each spectra will be. The default is to use the source
workspace name, but you can specify the name of a log value to use as
the label, e.g. Temp\_Sample. the LabelValue property allows control of
how a single value is extracted from time series logs.
