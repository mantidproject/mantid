Description
-----------

Calculates the scattering & transmission for Indirect Geometry
spectrometers. The sample chemical formula is input for the
SetSampleMaterial algorithm to calculate the cross-sections. The
instrument analyser reflection is selected to obtain the wavelength to
calculate the absorption cross-section. The sample number density &
thickness is input to then calculate the percentage scattering &
transmission.
