== Used Subalgorithms ==

The algorithm uses [[Unit_Factory|Unit Factory ]] and existing unit conversion procedures from input Workspace Units to the Units, necessary for transformation into correspondent MD Event workspace. It also uses [[PreprocessDetectorsToMD]] algorithm to help with transformation to reciprocal space.

== Notes ==
<ol>
<li> For elastic analysis (<math> dEAnalysisMode=Elastic</math>) the target [[units|unit]] is momentum <math>k</math>.
<li> For no analysis (CopyToMD) mode, the units remain the one, previously defined along the workspace's axes. 
<li> When units of input Matrix 2D workspace (Histogram workspace) are not Momentums for Elastic or EnergyTransfer for inelastic mode, the algorithm uses internal unit conversion of input X-values based on central average of a bin ranges. Namely, value <math>X_c = 0.5*(X_i+X_{i+1})</math> is calculated and converted to Momentum or EnergyTransfer correspondingly. This can give slightly different result from the case, when input workspace has been converted into correspondent units before converting to MDEvents. 
<li> Confusing message "Error in execution of algorithm ConvertToMD: emode must be equal to 1 or 2 for energy transfer calculation" is generated when one tries to process the results of inelastic scattering experiment in elastic mode. This message is generated by units conversion routine, which finds out that one of the workspace axis is in [[units|unit]] of DeltaE. These units can not be directly converted into momentum or energy, necessary for elastic mode. Select Direct or Indirect mode and integrate over whole energy transfer range to obtain MD workspace, which would correspond to an Elastic mode. 
</ol>


== How to write custom ConvertToMD plugin ==

This information intended for developers who have at least basic knowledge of C++ and needs to write its own [[Writing custom ConvertTo MD transformation |convertToMD plugin]].

== Usage examples ==
The examples below demonstrate the usages of the algorithm in most common situations. They work with the data files which already used by Mantid for different testing tasks.

=== Convert re-binned MARI 2D workspace to 3D MD workspace for further analysis/merging with data at different temperatures ===

<div style="border:1pt dashed blue; background:#f9f9f9;padding: 1em 0;">
<source lang="python">

Load(Filename='MAR11001.nxspe',OutputWorkspace='MAR11001')
SofQW3(InputWorkspace='MAR11001',OutputWorkspace='MAR11001Qe2',QAxisBinning='0,0.1,7',EMode='Direct')
AddSampleLog(Workspace='MAR11001Qe2',LogName='T',LogText='100',LogType='Number Series')

ConvertToMD(InputWorkspace='MAR11001Qe2',OutputWorkspace='MD3',QDimensions='CopyToMD',OtherDimensions='T',\
MinValues='-10,0,0',MaxValues='10,6,500',SplitInto='50,50,5')

</source>
</div>
Output '''MD3''' workspace can be viewed in slice-viewer as 3D workspace with T-axis having single value.

=== Convert Set of Event Workspaces (Horace scan) to 4D MD workspace, direct mode: ===

This example is based on CNCS_7860_event.nxs file, available in Mantid test folder. The same script without any changes would produce similar MD workspace given histogram data obtained from inelastic instruments and stored in nxspe files.

<div style="border:1pt dashed blue; background:#f9f9f9;padding: 1em 0;">
<source lang="python">

# Usually this energy is stored in workspace
# but if it is not, we have to provide it for inelastic conversion to work.

#
# set up target ws name and remove target workspace with the same name which can occasionally exist.

   DeleteWorkspace(RezWS)
except ValueError:
   print "Target ws ",RezWS," not found in analysis data service\n"

</source>
</div>

=== Convert set of inelastic results obtained in Powder mode (direct) as function of temperature to a 3D workspace: ===

The test example is based on MAR1011.nxspe data file, obtained by reducing test data from the MARI experiment. The data for the experiment can be located in [http://github.com/mantidproject/systemtests Mantid system test] folder. The text will produce 3-dimensional dataset, with temperature axis. The image does not change with temperature, as we have just cloned initial workspace without any changes to the experimental data.
