/** ScopedWorkspace : scoped workspace ADS entry.

  This class is provided for situations when you need a workspace to be in the
  ADS to run an
  algorithm, but you don't really need to keep it there after the algorithm has
  finished. In
  these circumstances you can create ScopedWorkspace, set it's name as a
  workspace property
  for the algorithm and retrieve it when algorithm has finished. The workspace
  will be
  removed from the ADS when the object goes out of scope, or exception is
  thrown.

  Primarily, it was created to overcome some limitations of WorkspaceProperties,
  but it can be
  useful in other places, e.g. tests.
