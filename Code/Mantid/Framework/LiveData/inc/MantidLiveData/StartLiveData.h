/** Algorithm that begins live data monitoring.
 *
 * The algorithm properties specify which instrument to observe,
 * with which method and starting from when.
 *
 * The algorithm will run LoadLiveData ONCE, and return the result
 * of the processing specified.
 *
 * This algorithm will launch MonitorLiveData ASYNCHRONOUSLY.
 * The MonitorLiveData will repeatedly call LoadLiveData at the desired update
 frequency.
