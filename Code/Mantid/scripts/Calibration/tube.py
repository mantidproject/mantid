def calibrate(ws, tubeSet, knownPositions, funcForm, **kwargs):
    """

      Define the calibrated positions of the detectors inside the tubes defined
      in tubeSet.

      Tubes may be considered a list of detectors alined that may be considered
      as pixels for the analogy when they values are displayed.

      The position of these pixels are provided by the manufactor, but its real
      position depends on the electronics inside the tube and varies slightly
      from tube to tube. The calibrate method, aims to find the real positions
      of the detectors (pixels) inside the tube.

      For this, it will receive an Integrated workspace, where a special
      measurement was performed so to have a
      pattern of peaks or through. Where gaussian peaks or edges can be found.


      The calibration follows the following steps

      1. Finding the peaks on each tube
      2. Fitting the peaks agains the Known Positions
      3. Defining the new position for the pixels(detectors)

      Let's consider the simplest way of calling calibrate:

      .. code-block:: python

         from tube import calibrate
         ws = Load('WISH17701')
         ws = Integration(ws)
         known_pos = [-0.41,-0.31,-0.21,-0.11,-0.02, 0.09, 0.18, 0.28, 0.39 ]
         peaks_form = 9*[1] # all the peaks are gaussian peaks
         calibTable = calibrate(ws,'WISH/panel03',known_pos, peaks_form)

      In this example, the calibrate framework will consider all the
      tubes (152) from WISH/panel03.
      You may decide to look for a subset of the tubes, by passing the
      **rangeList** option.

      .. code-block:: python

         # This code will calibrate only the tube indexed as number 3
         # (usually tube0004)
         calibTable = calibrate(ws,'WISH/panel03',known_pos,
                                peaks_form, rangeList=[3])

      **Finding the peaks on each tube**

      * Dynamically fitting peaks

       The framework expects that for each tube, it will find a peak pattern
       around the pixels corresponding to the known_pos positions.

       The way it will work out the estimated peak position (in pixel) is

       1. Get the length of the tube: distance(first_detector,last_detector) in the tube.
       2. Get the number of detectors in the tube (nDets)
       3. It will be assumed that the center of the tube correspond to the origin (0)

       .. code-block:: python

          centre_pixel = known_pos * nDets/tube_length + nDets/2

       It will them look for the real peak around the estimated value as:

       .. code-block:: python

          # consider tube_values the array of counts, and peak the estimated
          # position for the peak
          real_peak_pos = argmax(tube_values[peak-margin:peak+margin])

       After finding the real_peak_pos, it will try to fit the region around
       the peak to find the best expected position of the peak in a continuous
       space. It will do this by fitting the region around the peak to a
       Gaussian Function, and them extract the PeakCentre returned by the
       Fitting.

       .. code-block:: python

          centre = real_peak_pos
          fit_start, fit_stop = centre-margin, centre+margin
          values = tube_values[fit_start,fit_stop]
          background = min(values)
          peak = max(values) - background
          width = len(where(values > peak/2+background))
          # It will fit to something like:
          # Fit(function=LinerBackground,A0=background;Gaussian,
          # Height=peak, PeakCentre=centre, Sigma=width,fit_start,fit_end)

      * Force Fitting Parameters


       These dinamically values can be avoided by defining the **fitPar** for
       the calibrate function

       .. code-block:: python

          eP = [57.5, 107.0, 156.5, 206.0, 255.5, 305.0, 354.5, 404.0, 453.5]
          # Expected Height of Gaussian Peaks (initial value of fit parameter)
          ExpectedHeight = 1000.0
          # Expected width of Gaussian peaks in pixels
          # (initial value of fit parameter)
          ExpectedWidth = 10.0
          fitPar = TubeCalibFitParams( eP, ExpectedHeight, ExpectedWidth )
          calibTable = calibrate(ws, 'WISH/panel03', known_pos, peaks_form, fitPar=fitPar)

       Different Function Factors


       Although the examples consider only Gaussian peaks, it is possible to
       change the function factors to edges by passing the index of the
       known_position through the **funcForm**. Hence, considering three special
       points, where there are one gaussian peak and thow edges, the calibrate
       could be configured as:

       .. code-block:: python

          known_pos = [-0.1 2 2.3]
          # gaussian peak followed by two edges (through)
          form_factor = [1 2 2]
          calibTable = calibrate(ws,'WISH/panel03',known_pos,
                                 form_factor)

      * Override Peaks


       It is possible to scape the finding peaks position steps by providing the
       peaks through the **overridePeaks** parameters. The example below tests
       the calibration of a single tube (30) but scapes the finding peaks step.

       .. code-block:: python

          known_pos = [-0.41,-0.31,-0.21,-0.11,-0.02, 0.09, 0.18, 0.28, 0.39 ]
          define_peaks = [57.5, 107.0, 156.5, 206.0, 255.5, 305.0, 354.5,
                         404.0, 453.5]
          calibTable = calibrate(ws, 'WISH/panel03', known_pos, peaks_form,
                           overridePeaks={30:define_peaks}, rangeList=[30])

      * Output Peaks Positions

       Enabling the option **outputPeak** a WorkspaceTable will be produced with
       the first column as tube name and the following columns with the position
       where corresponding peaks were found. Like the table below.

       +-------+-------+-----+-------+
       |TubeId | Peak1 | ... | PeakM |
       +=======+=======+=====+=======+
       |tube0  | 15.5  | ... | 370.3 |
       +-------+-------+-----+-------+
       |  ...  |  ...  | ... |  ...  |
       +-------+-------+-----+-------+
       |tubeN  | 14.9  | ... | 371.2 |
       +-------+-------+-----+-------+

       The signature changes to:

       .. code-block:: python

          calibTable, peakTable = calibrate(...)

       It is possible to give a peakTable directly to the **outputPeak** option,
       which will make the calibration to append the peaks to the given table.

       .. hint::

         It is possible to save the peakTable to a file using the
         :meth:`savePeak` method.

      **Find the correct position along the tube**


       The second step of the calibration is to define the correct position of
       pixels along the tube. This is done by fitting the peaks positions found
       at the previous step against the known_positions provided.

       ::

        known       |              *
        positions   |           *
                    |      *
                    |  *
                    |________________
                      pixels positions

       The default operation is to fit the pixels positions against the known
       positions with a quadratic function in order to define an operation to
       move all the pixels to their real positions. If necessary, the user may
       select to fit using a polinomial of 3rd order, through the parameter
       **fitPolyn**.

       .. note::

         The known positions are given in the same unit as the spacial position
         (3D) and having the center of the tube as the origin.

       Hence, this section will define a function that:

       .. math:: F(pix) = RealRelativePosition

      **Define the new position for the detectors**

       Finally, the position of the detectors are defined as a vector operation
       like

       .. math::

         \\vec{p} = \\vec{c} + v \\vec{u}

       Where :math:`\\vec{p}` is the position in the 3D space, **v** is the
       RealRelativePosition deduced from the last session, and finally,
       :math:`\\vec{u}` is the unitary vector in the direction of the tube.



      :param ws: Integrated workspace with tubes to be calibrated.
      :param tubeSet: Specification of Set of tubes to be calibrated. If a string is passed, a TubeSpec will be created passing the string as the setTubeSpecByString.

       This will be the case for TubeSpec as string

       .. code-block:: python

         self.tube_spec = TubeSpec(ws)
         self.tube_spec.setTubeSpecByString(tubeSet)

       If a list of strings is passed, the TubeSpec will be created with this list:

       .. code-block:: python

          self.tube_spec = TubeSpec(ws)
          self.tube_spec.setTubeSpecByStringArray(tubeSet)

       If a :class:`~tube_spec.TubeSpec` object is passed, it will be used as it is.


      :param knownPositions: The defined position for the peaks/edges, taking the center as the origin and having the same units as the tube length in the 3D space.

      :param funcForm: list with special values to define the format of the peaks/edge (peaks=1, edge=2). If it is not provided, it will be assumed that all the knownPositions are peaks.


      Optionals parameters to tune the calibration:

      :param fitPar: Define the parameters to be used in the fit as a :class:`~tube_calib_fit_params.TubeCalibFitParams`. If not provided, the dynamic mode is used. See :py:func:`~Examples.TubeCalibDemoMaps_All.provideTheExpectedValue`

      :param margin: value in pixesl that will be used around the peaks/edges to fit them. Default = 15. See the code of :py:mod:`~Examples.TubeCalibDemoMerlin` where **margin** is used to calibrate small tubes.

       .. code-block:: python

          fit_start, fit_end = centre - margin, centre + margin

      :param rangeList: list of tubes indexes that will be calibrated. As in the following code (see: :py:func:`~Examples.TubeCalibDemoMaps_All.improvingCalibrationSingleTube`):

       .. code-block:: python

          for index in rangelist:
              do_calibrate(tubeSet.getTube(index))

      :param calibTable: Pass the calibration table, it will them append the values to the provided one and return it. (see: :py:mod:`~Examples.TubeCalibDemoMerlin`)

      :param plotTube: If given, the tube whose index is in plotTube will be ploted as well as its fitted peaks, it can receive a list of indexes to plot.(see: :py:func:`~Examples.TubeCalibDemoMaps_All.changeMarginAndExpectedValue`)

      :param excludeShortTubes: Do not calibrate tubes whose length is smaller than given value. (see at: Examples/TubeCalibDemoMerlin_Adjustable.py)

      :param overridePeaks: dictionary that defines an array of peaks positions (in pixels) to be used for the specific tube(key). (see: :py:func:`~Examples.TubeCalibDemoMaps_All.improvingCalibrationSingleTube`)

       .. code-block:: python

          for index in rangelist:
            if overridePeaks.has_key(index):
              use_this_peaks = overridePeaks[index]
              # skip finding peaks
              fit_peaks_to_position()

      :param fitPolyn: Define the order of the polinomial to fit the pixels positions agains the known positions. The acceptable values are 1, 2 or 3. Default = 2.


      :param outputPeak: Enable the calibrate to output the peak table, relating the tubes with the pixels positions. It may be passed as a boolean value (outputPeak=True) or as a peakTable value. The later case is to inform calibrate to append the new values to the given peakTable. This is usefull when you have to operate in subsets of tubes. (see :py:mod:`~Examples.TubeCalibDemoMerlin` that shows a nice inspection on this table).

       .. code-block:: python

         calibTable, peakTable = calibrate(ws, (omitted), rangeList=[1],
                  outputPeak=True)
         # appending the result to peakTable
         calibTable, peakTable = calibrate(ws, (omitted), rangeList=[2],
                  outputPeak=peakTable)
         # now, peakTable has information for tube[1] and tube[2]
