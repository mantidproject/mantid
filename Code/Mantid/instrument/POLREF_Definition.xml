  <!-- BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF CRISP INSTRUMENT: 
  
      Here Z=0 is defined by the neutron beam which slopes down at 1.5 deg. 
      from the horizon. This description is based on data provided by Tim
      Charlton and Rob Dalgliesh.
      
      Note from Tim spreedsheet
      theta is a rotation about the y axis
      phi is a rotation about the x axis
      chi is a rotation about the z axis

      Noticed the face of the monitors/detector shapes that faces the
      beam/sample path is in this IDF defined to be the y-z plane.
      
      Note the status of the instrument during a run is stored in the 
      logfile RunNo_status.txt
      
      Notes from Owen Arnold 16/07/2012: This IDF has been updated to include the OSMOND Line Detector.
