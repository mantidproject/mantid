<p><b>This is the new home of CxxTest. The old pages on SourceForge.net do not contain the new releases or any new developments.</b>

<p>CxxTest is a JUnit/CppUnit/xUnit-like framework for C/C++.
<p> It is focussed on being a lightweight framework that is well suited for integration into embedded systems development projects.

<p>CxxTest's advantages over existing alternatives are that it:
<ul>
<li>Doesn't require RTTI
<li>Doesn't require member template functions
<li>Doesn't require exception handling
<li>Doesn't require any external libraries (including memory management, file/console I/O, graphics libraries)
<li>Is distributed entirely as a set of header files (and a python script).
<li>Doesn't require the user to manually register tests and test suites
</ul>

<p>This makes it extremely portable and usable. 

<p> Currently CxxTest is about to get a major update. The stable version (3.10.1) is available in the documents and files section.
