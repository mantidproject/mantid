Info:
The bash script in this directory is used to build and package ParaView to Debian packages for Ubuntu platforms.
At the time of writing custom deployment is necessary for two reasons:

1) We distribute a slightly modified source version of ParaView 3.98.1. This script can be used with our patched source.
   Currently available at http://download.mantidproject.org
2) The default ParaView packaging puts libraries in subdirectories of lib and they therefore cannot be found by Mantid
   without manually modifying the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This packaging script will fix that issue.

Usage:

- In order to build the binary packages. Place the *.tar.gz  paraview source compressed file from
   http://download.mantidproject.org into an empty directory.

- Copy the accompanying *.sh script associated with this README into the same directory. Run the bash script.
  The packaged .*Deb binaries will appear in the /paraview/install directory at the end of the process.
