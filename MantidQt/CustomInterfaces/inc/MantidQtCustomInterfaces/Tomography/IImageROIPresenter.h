/**
Presenter for the widget that handles the selection of the center of
rotation, region of interest, region for normalization, etc. from an
image or stack of images. This is the abstract base class / interface
for the presenter (in the sense of the MVP pattern).  The name
ImageROI refers to the Center-of-Rotation, which is the most basic
parameter that users can select via this widget. This class is
QtGUI-free as it uses the interface of the view. The model is simply
the ImageStackPreParams class which holds coordinates selected by the
user.
