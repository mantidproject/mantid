/**
Widget to handle the selection of the center of rotation, region of
interest, region for normalization, etc. from an image or stack of
images. This is the abstract base class / interface for the view of
this widget (in the sense of the MVP pattern).  The name ImageROI
refers to the Center-of-Rotation, which is the most basic parameter
that users can select via this widget. This class is Qt-free. Qt
specific functionality and dependencies are added in a class derived
from this.
