This holds parameters for pre-processing images or stacks of images
for tomographic reconstruction. These parameters are used in different
pre-processing steps in the tomographic reconstruction pipeline, and
also for the reconstruction algorithms (iternative methods, FBP,
etc.).

The parameters include:
- center of rotation
- region of interest (clip from original or raw images)
- region for normalization (where the beam is not blocked by any sample 
  object throughout the stack of images) other parameters describing
  the stack of images:
