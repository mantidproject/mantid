Interface to the current parameters functionality of the Engineering
Diffraction (EnggDiffraction) GUI. This can be used in different
tabs/widgets as well as in the main/central view. Normally this
interface will be provided by the presenters of the widgets (assuming
an MVP design). The individual / area specific tabs/widgets (their
presenters) will forward to the widget responsible for the
calibration.
