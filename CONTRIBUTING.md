The [developer documentation](http://www.mantidproject.org/Category:Development) has information on how to participate in the mantid project as a developer. This document is meant to outline the steps for contributing to mantid without becomming a developer. We aspire to have similar guidelines as [github](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request).

 1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the repository.
 2. Make changes as you see fit. Please still follow the guidelines for [running the unit tests](http://www.mantidproject.org/Running_the_unit_tests) and the [build servers](http://www.mantidproject.org/The_automated_build_process).
 4. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to this branch. This is a start to the conversation.
 3. (Optional) email mantid-help@mantidproject.org requests to.

Hints to make the integration of your changes easy (and happen faster):
- Keep your pull requests small
- Some comments are part of the build server infrastructure (e.g. 'test this please')
- Don't forget your unit tests
- All algorithms need documentation, don't forget the .rst file
- Don't take changes requests to change your code personally
