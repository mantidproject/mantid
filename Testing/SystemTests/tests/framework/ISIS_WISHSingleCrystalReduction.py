    At the time of writing WISH users rely quite heavily on the PredictPeaks
    algorithm. As WISH has tubes rather than rectangular detectors sometimes
    peaks fall between the gaps in the tubes.

    Here we check that PredictPeaks works on a real WISH dataset & UB. This also
    includes an example of a peak whose center is predicted to fall between two
    tubes.
