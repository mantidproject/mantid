    Attempting to bin this type of data from event mode to histogram mode would
    then lead to odd effects as you would have clusters of events that were
    articifically at the "same" time period.
    For these files Mantid randomizes the TOF from within the bin it was
    assigned as it loads. Later files have this operation done by the DAE.
