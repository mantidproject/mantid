"""cxxtest: A Python package that supports the CxxTest test framework for C/C++.

.. _CxxTest: http://cxxtest.tigris.org/

The _CxxTest testing framework is focussed on being a lightweight
framework that is well suited for integration into embedded systems
development projects.

CxxTest's advantages over existing alternatives are that it:

* Doesn't require RTTI
* Doesn't require member template functions
* Doesn't require exception handling
* Doesn't require any external libraries (including memory management, file/console I/O, graphics libraries)
* Is distributed entirely as a set of header files (and a python script).
* Doesn't require the user to manually register tests and test suites

The cxxtest Python package includes capabilities for parsing C/C++ source files and generating
CxxTest drivers.
