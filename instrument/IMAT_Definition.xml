  <!-- BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF IMAT INSTRUMENT:
       IMAT (Imaging and Materials Science & Engineering)
       This IDF is for the 2 prototype banks, each with 200 detectors.
       
       The sample is considered Origin (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
       The source is at location z = -56.0, because it is 56 meters away from the sample.

       The way the instrument is built in the IDF is by:
         - First we define the monitors, as distance FROM the sample, hence the negative
         - Second we define both North and South bank, both of them being the same type object -> detector-bank.
              This means we can reuse the definition of a detector-bank for both.
              This also means that WE MUST rotate one of the banks otherwise they would face the same way.

    Here we define the spectra number for each detector. Each detector gets one spectra.
    The current structure leaves spectra 13 and 14 empty, so they are excluded.
    Excluded spectra:
      - 13 and 14: left empty
      - 215 to 249 are excluded
      - 449 to the end are excluded

    The current structure of the spectra is:
        We have 2 banks with 2 rows, and 100 detectors per row
        
        This means we have 400 detectors in total.

        15-214 is 200 detectors - the range is [15,214] (last index not excluded)
        250-449 is 200 detectors - same for the range [250,449]

        I have tried with 15-215, and 250-450, but Mantid fails to parse and the error
        is that we have more spectra than detectors. The [15,214], [250,449] range works.

    In the future we will still have 2 banks, but they will have more detector-blocks and maybe more pixels
    inside each detector-blocks
