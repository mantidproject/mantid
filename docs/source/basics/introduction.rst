About Mantid
============

The Mantid Framework has been created to manipulate and analyse neutron and muon scattering data.

The MantidPlot Graphical User Interface (GUI) is one way in which this framework can be accessed and used.
In addition to the GUI, Python scripts can be executed (both inside and outside of MantidPlot) that allow 
the automation of complex interactions with the framework

    * :ref:`training`, with links to further learning resources.
    * :ref:`concepts contents`, with deeper background information on aspects of Mantid.
    * :ref:`interfaces contents`, with details of the bespoke technique interfaces available.
    * :ref:`fitting contents`, with a guide to the science and art of fitting functions to data.
    * :ref:`techniques contents`, with further information relevant to some of the specific scientific techniques.
    * :ref:`Mantid Matplotlib Plot Gallery and Examples <plotting>`, with details of how to make pretty plots.


+ In addition to documentation we also have
    * A `forum <http://forum.mantidproject.org/>`_.
    * An email address: `mantid-help@mantidproject.org <mailto:mantid-help@mantidproject.org>`__.
