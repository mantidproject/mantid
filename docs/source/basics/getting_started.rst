Setting up and getting started
==============================


Installing Mantid
=================

Mantid is available to download for Mac, Linux or Windows. Pre-compiled executable binaries are available to download from the
`Downloads section <http://download.mantidproject.org/>`_ of the website.

On the downloads page you will be able to get the latest stable release of Mantid, which we recommend. There is also an option
to download the latest nightly build, this is a more experimental version of the code. Whilst the nightly build may have more
features, it is less tested and comes with much less guarantee.

You will also find detailed instructions for installing Mantid on any of the above mentioned operating systems.

MantidPlot First-time Setup
===========================

The first time you start up MantidPlot you will get the "First-
time Setup" screen, pictured below. This screen allows you to set 
default options related to the instrument from which your data 
was collected, and the locations to look for data by default. You 
can also access certain resources directly from this screen.

If you do not want to see this screen every time you start 
Mantid, you can check the "Do not show again until next release" 
box. You can re-access this screen from the main MantidPlot GUI 
at any time by going to "Help > First Time Setup".
