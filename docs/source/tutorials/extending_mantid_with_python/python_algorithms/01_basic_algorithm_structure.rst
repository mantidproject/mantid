Basic Algorithm Structure
=========================

Each Python algorithm within Mantid must contain a few elements in order for
it to be recognised as an algorithm.

The basic layout should look like:

.. code-block:: python

    from mantid.kernel import *
    from mantid.api import *

    class HelloWorld(PythonAlgorithm):

        def PyInit(self):
            # Declare properties
            pass

        def PyExec(self):
            # Run the algorithm
            pass

    # Register algorithm with Mantid
    AlgorithmFactory.subscribe(HelloWorld)

The super class is ``PythonAlgorithm``, which provides a hook to allow Mantid
to interact with it without knowing about it beforehand.

The functions ``PyInit`` and ``PyExec`` are called by the framework to setup
properties and run the algorithm respectively and must be included.

The final line, which should be outside the class definition, registers the
new algorithm class with Mantid.

Each algorithm needs to belong to a category, by default a Python algorithm
belongs to the "PythonAlgorithms", but Mantid will emit a warning on
registration if you leave it using the default value. To change this include
the ``category()`` function in the definition, i.e.

.. code-block:: python

    from mantid.kernel import *
    from mantid.api import *

    class HelloWorld(PythonAlgorithm):

        def category(self):
            return 'MyTools'

       # The rest is the same as above

Subcategories can be defined using a **"\\\\\\\\"** (you need two **\\\\**'s as the first is
the escape character) to separate the categories. You can also state that
your algorithm should appear in multiple categories by separating them with
a semi-colon **";"**.

i.e. The following code defines that the algorithm should be stored in
Useful->Tools and MyTools.

.. code-block:: python

    from mantid.kernel import *
    from mantid.api import *

    class HelloWorld(PythonAlgorithm):

        def category(self):
            return 'Useful\\Tools;MyTools'

        # The rest is the same as above
