Mantid ships with many predefined :ref:`Algorithms List`.

Python algorithms provide a mechanism to define extra algorithms at run time
that Mantid treats exactly the same as if they were shipped with the package.

Benefits of an algorithm over just writing in a script:

#. Create workspaces that are seen by Mantid - Improved performance for your
   specific task
#. History tracking - Python processing in a standard script isn't tracked in
   the workspace history but it is through a Python algorithm
#. Free GUI - All algorithms have a default auto-generated input GUI
