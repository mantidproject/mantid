Introduction

Workspaces are the data storage units of Mantid. If you
want to create, save or manipulate in any way a workspace this is done
using Mantid Algorithms.

For example an algorithm is used when loading data into a workspace. The
current list of available
`algorithms <http://docs.mantidproject.org/algorithms>`_ is very large,
but most algorithms interact with workspaces in the same way, outputting
a new workspace as the result.

In this section we will introduce you to some basic types of workspaces,
and some key algorithms to operate upon those workspaces.
