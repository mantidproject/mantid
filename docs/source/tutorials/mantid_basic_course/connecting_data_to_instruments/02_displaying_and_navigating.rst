Opening the Instrument View
===========================

To see the Instrument View

#. Load a data set, such as MUSR00015189
#. As this is a WorkspaceGroup, reveal the contained workspaces by clicking on the small triangle
#. Right-click on the workspace named MUSR0001589_1 in the Workspaces Toolbox and select "Show Instrument"


Different projections
=====================

There are two ways to display the instrument geometry: the Full 3D view and
an "unwrapped" view. An "unwrapped" view shows a projection of the
instrument onto a surface (a cylinder or a sphere) unfolded onto the
screen. Use this drop-down menu to select the type of the projection

Here is an example of how an instrument may look in different views:

Settings
========

Some aspects of the instrument appearance in the view can be set from
the Display Settings drop-down menu.

Navigating in 3D
================

In the 3D view:

-  :red:`The X axis is red.`
-  :green:`The Y axis is green.`
-  :blue:`The Z axis is blue.`

In most cases, the :blue:`Z axis` is the direction of the incident beam, but not for every instrument!

Rotate the instrument by left-clicking and dragging.

Pan the view by right-clicking and dragging.

Zoom in and out by scrolling or holding down the middle button
and dragging up and down.

Zooming in 2D
=============

In an unwrapped view (such as cylindrical) to zoom in select an area by left-clicking and
dragging.

Right click to zoom out.
