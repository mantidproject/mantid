Opening the Instrument View
===========================

To see the Instrument View

#. Load a data set, such as MUSR00015189 (as this is a WorkspaceGroup, reveal the Workspaces by clicking on the small triangle)
#. Right-click on the workspace in the Workspaces Toolbox and select "Show Instrument"


Different projections
=====================

There are two ways to display the instrument geometry: the 3D view and
an "unwrapped" view. An "unwrapped" view shows a projection of the
instrument onto a surface (a cylinder or a sphere) unfolded onto the
screen. Use this drop-down menu to select the type of the projection

Here is an example of how an instrument may look in different views:

Some aspects of the instrument appearance in the view can be set from
the Display Settings drop-down menu.
