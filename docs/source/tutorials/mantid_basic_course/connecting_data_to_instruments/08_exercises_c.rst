Exercise 1
==========

-  **Load** *SXD23767.raw* into Mantid
-  Open the Instrument View
-  Make sure the colour map is set to "jet" and the display type to "Spherical Z".
-  Change the colour scale to *SymmetricLog10* set the scale range to be between
   100 and 5e4
-  Go to the *Pick* tab, choose *Add single crystal peak*
   |PickTabAddPeakButton.png| go to a Bragg peak and left-click. The
   mini-plot should now be showing a plot of counts vs TOF for that
   detector.
-  Move the mouse over the mini-plot, **right-click** the mouse and
   select *Save plot to workspace*, plot the workspace called *Curves*
   which should now be in the Workbench main window Workspace Toolbox.
-  Go back to the Instrument View, and the same mini-plot. This time
   **left-click** on a peak in the mini-plot to select it. A new peak
   should be shown in the instrument view. A workspace (PeaksWorkspace)
   called *SingleCrystalPeakTable* should also exist now in the
   Workspace Toolbox.

-  Double click the new PeaksWorkspace to open it as a table and verify
   that the TOF value is the same as shown in the mini-plot and the
   detector ID is the same as shown in the text area above the mini plot
   [Tip: click and drag in the mini-plot to zoom in!]
-  Now in the Instrument View window use the *Erase single crystal
   peak(s)* |PickTabEraseButton.png| tool to remove the Peak just added

Exercise 2
==========

Here we are going to mask out the beam stop and the edge of the main
detector for a small angle dataset.

#. Load LOQ48097 data set.
#. Open the Instrument View by right-clicking on the workspace and
   selecting Show Instrument.
#. Display Full 3D on Render tab.
#. Change the Axis view to Z+ (to avoid having a view with the front LOQ
   detector in front of the main detector)
#. Make sure that the colour map axis has the *SymmetricLog10* scaling.
#. Set the Scale limits to 1 and 2378 (the max is the default). The
   instrument display should look like this:

#. Switch to the Draw tab.
#. Select the ellipse drawing button |PickTabEllipseButton.png|.
#. Draw an ellipse in the middle of the panel to cover completely the
   blue disk there. [Tip: Set the Instrument View window to full screen to make this easier!]
   
   |LOQEllipseMasking.png|

#. Select the button for drawing a rectangular ring
   |PickTabRectRingButton.png|
#. Draw a ring masking the edge detectors of the panel. Use its control
   points to adjust it to the right size and thickness.
   
   |LOQRectRingMasking.png|

#. Click |ApplyToViewButton.png| button.

   |LOQAppliedMask.png|

#. Click Apply and Save button and select "As Detector Mask to workspace". A
   workspace named "MaskWorkspace" is created.
#. Click |ClearAllButton.png| button. The instrument image returns to
   the original, all masking is removed.
#. Right-click on "MaskWorkspace" and select Show Instrument.
#. Change to Full 3D, Z+. The image should look something like this:
