===========================

“A picture is worth a thousand words”, para-phrased from Henrik Ibsen: "A thousand words leave not the same deep impression as does a single deed."

Many others have written similar sentiments: Leonardo Da Vinci wrote that a poet would be "overcome by sleep and hunger before [being able to] describe with words what a painter is able to in an instant."
