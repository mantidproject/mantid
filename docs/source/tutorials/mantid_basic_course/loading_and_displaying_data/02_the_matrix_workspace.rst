Viewing Data 
============


Workspace Toolbox
=================

Mantid Workbench needs a way of storing the data it loads into something.
These 'somethings' are called workspaces. You can see all of the
Workspaces that Mantid has loaded in the Workspaces toolbox, together
with buttons to Load, Delete, Group (changes to Ungroup if already Grouped), Sort and Save Workspaces. There is also a search bar to filter by name.

Next to each workspace is a little triangle you can click to view a
few more details about the workspace.


Workspace Matrix View - Show Data
=================================

The dialog below is the workspace matrix view, and
can be used to look at histogram or event data. To create one, right-click the workspace name and select "Show Data".

Normal Data is displayed with a light blue background. Spectra that correspond to monitor detectors appear as the first rows
and are marked with a light yellow background. A monitor is a low efficiency detector of the particle beam, that can be placed before and after the sample, that can be used for normalisation. The rows corresponding to
the masked detectors (if present) will be highlighted with a light grey
background. If a monitor spectrum itself is masked, it will be marked
with light grey just as other masked spectra. Masked bins will also be
marked with light grey, except for EventWorkspaces (we will return to this later).

Each **row** in the matrix shows data values of a single spectra. By
flipping between the tabs you can see the X, Y and E values.

-  "Y values"" contains the counts found in each bin of the spectrum.
-  "X values" contains the Bin boundaries or Bin centres of the X axis. If
   they are bin Boundaries you will have one more column in the X tab
   than you do in the Y or E tabs.
-  "E contains" the errors associated with the counts. For most raw data
   this will initially be the square root of Y on loading.

The Index number refers to the bin it relates to. On the "Y values" and "E values" tabs there is another number (above displayed with the unit 'Î¼s').

The first number at the left of each row we call the "Workspace Index" and 
is simply the row number as data is read into the
workspace; in the same way as a spreadsheet program like Excel uses row
numbers. This always starts from zero, but the corresponding Spectrum 
Number is displayed as 'sp 1'. 
Often it is the case that the Spectrum Number is one greater than the 
Workspace Index, but this is not always the case. If you only load part
of a file, for example spectra 100 - 200, then the Workspace Indices
will still be 0-100, but Mantid will remember the original Spectra
Number of each spectrum.


Linking Workspace Index to Detector IDs
=======================================

The data in each spectrum can come from one or more detectors. You can get
spectra linked to multiple detectors either by hardware detector
grouping or by grouping the detectors in Mantid. To see the Detector table right-click on the workspace name and select "Show Detectors".

This table contains Workspace
Indices, Spectrum Numbers, Detector IDs and locations of the detectors,
together with a flag showing which are monitors. If a spectrum contains
a group of detectors then the position shown will be the average
position of those detectors.

In the example above, the first three spectra correspond to data from
monitors. The fourth spectrum (with a Spectrum Number of -1) loaded from
the MAR11060 run is for some reason not present in the Instrument
definition, and the remaining rows that are visible show histograms
wired up to detectors with spectrum number 5-7 or equivalently detectors
with IDs of 4101-3.
