Mantid is actively developed and as part of that we offer some User Support. While often your Instrument Scientist is your first port of call, you can contact us in a number of ways.


Contact Us
----------

We are always keen for feedback, so if you have any suggestions for improving Mantid, then please contact us.

1. Through the `Mantid Help Forum <https://forum.mantidproject.org/>`_. Report a problem or ask for help. Remember to tag an appropriate topic.

This is quickly accessible through the top Toolbar in Mantid "Help > Mantid Forum"

2. Mantid Help email: mantid-help@mantidproject.org

Both of these methods go straight to our User Support Officer.


Error Reporter
--------------

At some stage you will inevitably see an Error Reporter. Please provide your name and email address, so we can investigate and solve your problem! Include as much detail as possible. If you can crash mantid, we want to know how!

Most of the functionality of Mantid is encompassed in our User Documentation. You can access it via the `webpage <https://www.mantidproject.org/Main_Page>`_ and in the drop-down menu "Help > Mantid Help, Algorithms, Concepts".
