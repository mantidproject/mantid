Differences between MantidPlot and Workbench
============================================

While much of MantidPlot's functionality can be replicated through the python scripts the interface on Workbench does
lack some aspects that you have used in previous parts of this tutorial.

Plotting tools
==============

In the loading_and_displaying_data chapter you learnt how to create 2D colour plots and 3D surface plots. Colour plots
in Workbench cannot have their colour bar scale changed between linear and logarithmic removing the usefulness of
colourfill plots. Workbench also lacks an interface for producing 3D plots at all, as well as the advanced plot tool
that was present in MantidPlot. Access to these plots must be done through Matplotlib directly, it may help to consult
the `Matplotlib in Mantid tutorial <https://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/plotting/index.html#simple-plots>`_.



Interfaces
==========

MantidPlot provides a range of different interfaces that are still in the process of being implemented in Workbench. As of
Mantid 4.2, the interfaces available through Workbench are:

* Diffraction

  - HFIR 4 Circle Reduction
  
  - Powder Diffraction Reduction
