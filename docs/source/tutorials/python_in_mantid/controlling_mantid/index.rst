* To display results within MantidPlot, a user can view workspaces as a matrix and also plot graphs from the results.

* There is also an instrument view which displays a 3D model of the instrument with the detectors marked up by colours based upon the data in the workspace.

* All of these elements can be controlled by a Python script so that repetitive tasks can be scripted.
