* This information can be used to generate a script to rerun the algorithms that created that workspace.

* To view the history of a workspace in MantidPlot, right click on the entry within the Mantid Workspaces box and select Show History.

* A window detailing the history of the workspace will appear with a button that allows a user to generate a script based upon the actions that are described.
