Generalising a Script
=====================


#An example of an algorithm dialog

* The script generated from the history window will be specific to the properties contained within it.

* A more useful script will be able to handle different parameters with each use.

..* When algorithms are executed from the Mantid Algorithms box in the bottom right corner, a dialog appears so that a user can enter the required properties for that run. These dialog boxes can also be accessed from Python.

..* Each algorithm function has a corresponding function of the same name with the word Dialog appended to it. Calling this function shows the dialog for that algorithm where users can enter their property values.
