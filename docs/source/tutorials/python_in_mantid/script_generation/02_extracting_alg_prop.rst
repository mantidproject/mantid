Extracting Algorithm Properties
===============================

After an algorithm has been executed the properties remain available to access as long as the produced workspace is in existence.
Algorithms return their output properties as a tuple, which python can unpack automatically, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    sample = Load('MAR11015.raw')
    ei, mon_peak, mon_index, tzero = GetEi(sample, Monitor1Spec=2,Monitor2Spec=3,EnergyEstimate=12)
    sample = ConvertUnits(sample, Target='DeltaE', Emode='Direct',EFixed=ei)

* To access input properties, use the :ref:`workspace history <Workspace-Workspace_History>`. Using this handle allows the properties to be extracted by their name using the `getPropertyValue()` function:

.. code-block:: python

    sample = Load('MAR11015.raw')
    algorithm = sample.getHistory().lastAlgorithm()
    filename = algorithm.getPropertyValue("Filename")
