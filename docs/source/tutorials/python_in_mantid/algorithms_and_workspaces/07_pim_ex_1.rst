Using ISIS Data
===============

Removing the HRPD Prompt Pulse
------------------------------

The HRPD data contains a spike every 20 milliseconds. While this is nicely localized in time-of-flight, it is not the case upon conversion to d-spacing.

The aim of this exercise is to use Mantid to write a script, not point-and-click, to exclude the contribution from the pulse.

Performing the Analysis
#######################

#. Load - Load the given HRPD data set, HRP39182.RAW into a workspace called 'HRP39182'
#. MaskBins - Mask out the bins corresponding to the pulse with XMin=19990 and XMax=20040 and an output workspace called â€˜masked'
#. Repeat the previous step for the other 4 pulses, each of which is 20000 microseconds after the previous. All MaskBins executions should happen on the same InputWorkspace so that all 5 pulses are masked from the same workspace.
Hint: A loop might be useful.
#. AlignDetectors - Correct the masked workspace for small variations in detector position, using the calibration file "hrpd_new_072_01_corr.cal". (Note: This performs an explicit conversion to dSpacing)
#. DiffractionFocussing - Focus the data in the masked workspace using the same cal file as the previous step (called a grouping file here)

Using SNS Data
==============

#. LoadEventNexus - Load the given POWGEN data set, PG3_4871 into a workspace named 'PG3_4871'. If you need to reduce the number of events loaded, select only the first 4000 seconds of the run.
#. View the number of events in the logging window with the command logger.notice(message) (The function to get the number of events is 'getNumberEvents()'.
#. FilterBadPulses - Remove events that occurred while the accelerator was resetting. You can view the logs by right clicking on the workspace and selecting 'Sample logs...'
#. AlignDetectors - Convert to d-spacing using the supplied calibration file called PG3_golden.cal
#. Rebin - Bin the data in d-spacing from 1.4 to 8 angstroms using logarithmic binning of .0004.
#. DiffractionFocussing - Focus the data in the workspace using the same cal file as the previous step (PG3_golden.cal).
#. CompressEvents - Saves some memory. Note the number of events again.

Using ILL Data
==============

#. Load - Load the given IN6 data sets, '164198.nxs', '164199.nxs' and '164200.nxs' into workspaces named after the filename.
#. MergeRuns - Merge all the previously loaded data sets into a single workspaced called 'data_merged'.
#. MaskDetectors - Remove bad spectra indices : 1,2,3,4,5,6,11,14,30,69,90,93,95,97,175,184,190,215,216,217,251,252,253,255,289,317,335 and 337.
#. MultiplyRange - Calculate sample transmission of 95%.
#. ConvertUnits - Convert the data from TOF to Delta Energy.
#. DetectorEfficiencyCorUser - Calculate the detector efficiency for this instrument.
