Workspace Types Via Python
==========================


A Workspace object will always be one of these Python types ITableWorkspace, MatrixWorkspace, WorkspaceGroup or MDWorkspace. The MatrixWorkspace is the most commonly used and is often referred to simply as a workspace. Usage of the MDWorkspace is not required for this course.
All Workspace types have at least these methods:

getComment()
Returns a string with any comment that was loaded into the workspace, usually when it was initially created from a data file.
getMemorySize()
Returns the number of kilobytes of RAM that the workspace is currently using.
getName()
Returns the name of the workspace as a string.
getTitle()
Returns a string containing the title that was loaded into the workspace.

Example

.. code-block:: python

    ws = Load(Filename="GEM38370_Focussed.nxs", OutputWorkspace="myWS")
    print(ws.getComment())
    print(ws.getMemorySize())
    print(ws.getName())
    print(ws.getTitle())
    print(ws)
