Basic Python Exercises
=======================

-  Here we will try some exercises to get to grips with the basics of
   Python

Exercise 1
==========

-  Write a program that prints out the square of the first 20 integers
   in a block such that the block is a rectangle of size 4x5. (Hint: One
   method uses the ``%`` (modulo) operator to test if a number is a
   multiple of another number. The answer is the remainder of the
   division of the lhs into whole parts, e.g. 4 % 1 = 0, 4 % 2 = 0, 4 %
   3 = 1, 4 % 4 = 0)

Exercise 2
==========

-  Write a program that prints out the first 25 Fibonacci numbers. (The
   Fibonacci sequence starts as with ``0,1`` and next number is the sum
   of the two previous numbers)

   -  Extend the program to also print the ratio of successive numbers
      of the sequence.
