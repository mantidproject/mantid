Solutions To Exercises
======================

Exercise 1
==========

-  Write a program that prints out the square of the first 20 integers
   in a block such that the block is a rectangle of size 4x5. (Hint: One
   method uses the ``%`` (modulo) operator to test if a number is a
   multiple of another number. The answer is the remainder of the
   division of the lhs into whole parts, e.g. 4 % 1 = 0, 4 % 2 = 0, 4 %
   3 = 1, 4 % 4 = 0)

.. code:: python

   # Write a program that prints out the square of the first
   # 20 integers a block such that the block has a dimension of 4x5.

   for i in range(1,21):
       print(str(i*i).center(3),end=' ') # center is a function for strings that centers the contents to the given width
       if i % 4 == 0:
           print()

   # ------------ Produces -------------
   # 1   4   9   16
   # 25  36  49  64
   # 81 100 121 144
   #169 196 225 256
   #289 324 361 400

Exercise 2
==========

-  Write a program that prints out the first 25 Fibonacci numbers. (The
   Fibonacci sequence starts as with ``0,1`` and next number is the sum
   of the two previous numbers)

   -  Extend the program to also print the ratio of successive numbers
      of the sequence.

.. code:: python

   # prev_2 - One before previous number
   # prev_1 - Previous number
   prev_2, prev_1 = 0, 1

   # Already have first 2 terms above
   print(prev_2)
   print(prev_1)

   # Now the next 23 terms (range(0,23) will run the loop 23 times)
   for i in range(0,23):
       current = prev_2 + prev_1
       # Ratio to previous
       ratio = float(current)/prev_1
       print(str(current) + " ratio to previous= " +str(ratio))
       # Move the previous markers along one for the next time around
       prev_2 = prev_1
       prev_1 = current

Exercise 3
==========

-  Starting with your solution to exercise 2, rewrite your code so that
   you have a function called ``fib`` that accepts a number. The
   function should compute a fibonacci sequence containing this many
   elements and return them as a list.

.. code:: python

   # Write a program that builds a list of the first 20 Fibonacci numbers, then
   ## Use the list to print out the value of the ratio of successive numbers of the sequence,
   ##   printing out the final value.
   ## Extend the program so that the Fibonacci list is calculated in a function that takes the
   ##   number of required values as a parameter and returns the list.

   # Function to calculate the first n fibonacci numbers
   # and return them as a list
   def fib(nfibs):
       if nfibs == 0:
           return []
       elif nfibs == 1:
           return [0]
       else:
           pass
       # First two numbers
       fibs = [0,1]
       if nfibs == 2:
           return fibs
       for i in range(2, nfibs):
           fibs.append(fibs[i-2] + fibs[i-1])
       return fibs

   #### fib ends here ####

   # Print out successive ratio remembering that the first number is a zero
   nfibs = 20
   fib_nums = fib(nfibs)
   for i in range(1,nfibs):
       try:
           numerator = fib_nums[i]
           denominator = fib_nums[i-1]
           ratio = float(numerator)/denominator
       except ZeroDivisionError:
           print('Warning: Invalid ratio: ' + str(numerator) + '/' + str(denominator))
       else:
           print('Ratio ' + str(numerator) + '/' + str(denominator) + ': ' + str(ratio))

   ##### Produces #####
   #Warning: Invalid ratio: 1/0
   #Ratio 1/1:  1.0
   #Ratio 2/1:  2.0
   #Ratio 3/2:  1.5

Exercise 4
==========

-  Write a program that creates a dictionary and initializes it with 5
   names/ID pairs.

   -  Create a function that prints out the dictionary as a 2 columns:
      the first being the key and the second the value
   -  Update the dictionary with another 5 name/values and reprint the
      table, making sure you understand the ordering within the map

.. code:: python

   # Write a program that creates a dictionary and initializes it with 5 names/ID pairs.
   ## Create a function that prints out the dictionary in a nicely formatted table;
   ## Update the dictionary with another 5 name/values and reprint the table,
   ##   making sure you understand the ordering within the map.

   def formatLine(cola, colb, width):
       return cola.center(width) + '|' + colb.center(width)

       for k in store:
           if len(k) > col_width:

   outputStore(phone_book)

   # Update Dictionary (replacing one person's phone number
   new_entries = {'Bjarne Strousoup' : 9876, 'Bill Gates' : 9898, 'Steve Jobs' : 7898, \
                 'Bob' : 9871, 'Dave' : 7098 }

   phone_book.update(new_entries)
   outputStore(phone_book)

Exercise 5
==========

#. Build a list containing the 5 filenames of the text files that are
   going to be used. (Hint: Can be done by hand or using the
   os.listdir('dirpath') function in the os module)
#. Add a bogus file name that doesn't exist to the list (so that we have
   to do some error handling)
#. Loop over the list and for each file (Remember here that we have a
   non existent file in the list and calling open on this will result in
   an IOError exception that needs to be dealt with)

   #. Open the file;
   #. Loop over each line;
   #. Split the line up into sections (Hint: The string has a
      ``.split()`` function that splits the string on whitespace and
      gives back a list with each section as an element of the list)
   #. Convert the second column value into an float
   #. Keep track of the values for each line and compute an average for
      the file.

#. Finally, print out a list of file,average-value pairs
