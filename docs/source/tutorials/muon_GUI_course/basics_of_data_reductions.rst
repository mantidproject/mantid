The concept of |tzero| and |tgood|
==================================

Since the muon data collected at ISIS is pulsed, the analysis of data produced by the equipment
must account for this. The concept of |tzero| and |tgood| and is what is used to determine the start of a good pulsed data set.

The timing origin, |tzero|, for the muon response in the sample is when the middle of the
muon pulse has reached the sample.

However, the good data region is not obtained until the *entire
pulse* has arrived at the sample, this time is defined as |tgood|.

The difference between |tgood|  and |tzero|  is t\ :sub:`good offset`\ .

When using the Muon Analysis GUI, |tzero| and |tgood| are loaded from the NeXuS file (having
been determined by the instrument scientist).

The concept of dead-time
========================

After a detector has recorded a positron count there is a small time interval before it is able
to detect another count. It is possible, especially at the high data collection rates now
available on the muon instruments, that a positron will arrive within this interval and not be
recorded. Statistical analysis can be used to correct for this. A silver sample is used to
determine dead time values for each detector, the results of which are made into a dead
time data file. The NeXuS format stores this data internally. **For further information about
the correction of detector deadtime see: Kilcoyne, RAL report RAL-94-080 (1994).**

To observe the effect of dead time, follow the instructions below:

1.  Open the Muon Analysis GUI and make sure 'none' is selected for Dead Time Correction (in the Instrument section of the Home :ref:`Tab<the_tabs_home>`)
2.  Load data file `EMU00034998.nxs` using the GUI.
3.  This example is best viewed with a fixed rebin with steps of ten, select `Fixed` from the dropdown menu and then type `10` into the box.
4.  A simple way to compare this data to some with dead time correction is to change the name so that Mantid does not automatically update the workspace.
    Go to the workspaces pane and navigate via `EMU34998` > `EMU34998 Pairs`, and right click on the Rebin dataset, then select `Rename` and pick a suitable new
    name such as `NoDeadTime`, then click on Run.
5.  Plot this data as described by Loading Data in :ref:`other_mantid_functions`.
6.  The effect of the dead time correction is most apparent in the first 16 :math:`{\mu s}`, to easily view this portion of the data, use the `Figure Options` to set the plot's
    the X-Axis limits to `0-16` :math:`{\mu s}`, and Y-Axis limits to `0.158-0.176`. How to do this is given in the Overlaying Data and Changing Plot Style section of :ref:`other_mantid_functions`.
7.  Reopen the Mantid Muon GUI and change the setting of the Dead Time Correction drop-down menu from `None` to `from data file`.
8.  Return to the `EMU34998 Pairs` workspace as in step 4. There should now be a new Rebin dataset along with the renamed one, Overplot this new spectrum onto the plot of `NoDeadTime`.
    (see Overlaying Data and Changing Plot Style section of :ref:`other_mantid_functions` for this process). Consider the differences between the two curves.

The detector calibration factor, Alpha
======================================

The detector calibration factor, α, used to normalise the asymmetry, can be determined by the use of the Guess Alpha
tool on any detector group pairing. By default, using the asymmetry equation shown below, the α value is approximated
to be 1. However, the Guess Alpha tool allows for a more accurate determination of the α value for a particular data set.

As an exercise, follow the instructions below to guess an :math:`{\alpha}` value and observe the resulting changes.

1. Using the GUI, load a transverse field measurement, such as `MUSR00024563`.
2. Select the Grouping tab

Note that when a data file is loaded using the GUI, the default option for the MuSR spectrometer is to GROUP (or add) all data in detectors 1-32
(a group of detectors referred to as `bck`) together. Similarly, data in detectors 33-64 (a group called `fwd`) is summed.

3. To generate :math:`{\alpha}` click on `Guess Alpha`. This process is shown in Figure 15.

What has happened? (reloading the data file might be needed to observe the changes.)

4. Try creating a pair called `sample_long` as described in :ref:`the_tabs_grouping` and using `Guess Alpha` with this group highlighted rather than `long`. Consider the changes that can be observed.
