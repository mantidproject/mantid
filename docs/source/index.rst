======
Mantid
======

The Mantid Framework has been created to visualise, manipulate and analyse neutron and muon scattering data. Mantid can be used though several Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and programming languages, including:

* `MantidPlot <https://www.mantidproject.org/MantidPlot:_Help>`_, the original interface supporting a wide range of techniques and visualisation approaches.
* :ref:`MantidWorkbench <workbench>`, A modern interface with growing supports for a list of techniques.
* Autoreduction services at specific facilities, including ISIS and the `SNS <https://monitor.sns.gov>`_.
* API's for :ref:`Python <pythonapi>` and `C++ <http://doxygen.mantidproject.org/>`_.

This is the documentation for Mantid |release|.

**Getting Started:**
  * :ref:`mantid_basic_course`, takes you through installing and basic use of Mantid through Mantidplot, including loading, visualising and fitting data.
  * :ref:`training`, links to further self paced courses and learning resources.
  * :ref:`Mantid Matplotlib Plot Gallery and Examples <plotting>`, details of how to make pretty plots and manioukate them via Python.
  * :ref:`muon_GUI_course`, focuses on the reduction and analysis of muon data collected from any of the ISIS muon spectrometers via a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

**Reference Documentation:**
  * :ref:`Algorithms List`, specific details for all of our algorithms including descriptions of all inputs and parameters .
  * :ref:`workbench` provides details on the new graphical user interface with matplotlib-based plotting.
  * :ref:`concepts contents`, deeper background information on the fundamental concepts within Mantid.
  * :ref:`interfaces contents`, descriptions of the bespoke technique interfaces available.
  * :ref:`fitting contents`, details of all the supported fitting functions and minimization approaches.
  * :ref:`techniques contents`, with further information relevant to some of the specific scientific techniques.
  * API's for :ref:`Python <pythonapi>` and `C++ <http://doxygen.mantidproject.org/>`_.
  * :ref:`release_notes`, a catalog of all of the release notes since v3.5.2.

**Other Help and Documentation:**
    * A `forum <http://forum.mantidproject.org/>`_, to ask for help, report issues, and discuss with other Mantid users.
    * A built in error-reporter. We really encourage you to use this, as it helps us to make Mantid more stable in future.
    * `Developer Documentation <http://developer.mantidproject.org/>`_
