Data reduction for D7 instrument at the ILL
===========================================

.. contents:: Table of contents
    :local:

There are three workflow algorithms supporting data reduction at ILL's D7 polarised diffraction and spectroscopy instrument. These algorithms are:

:ref:`algm-D7YIGPOsitionCalibration`
    Performs wavelength and position calibraiton for D7 instrument banks and individual detectors in banks. 

:ref:`algm-PolDiffILLReduction`
    Performs data reduction and produces the unnormalised sample cross-sections in one of the available units.

:ref:`algm-D7AbsoluteCrossSections`
    Performs cross-section separation into nuclear coherent, spin-incoherent and magnetic components, and does the data normalisation.

Together with the other algorithms and services provided by the Mantid framework, the reduction algorithms can handle a number of reduction scenarios. If this proves insufficient, however, the algorithms can be accessed using Python. Before making modifications it is recommended to copy the source files and rename the algorithms as not to break the original behavior.

This document tries to give an overview on how the algorithms work together via Python examples. Please refer to the algorithm documentation for details of each individual algorithm.


Reduction workflow and recommendations
######################################

A description of the usage of the algorithms for the D7 data reduction is presented along with several possible workflows, depending on the number of desired corrections and the type of normalisation.

Reduction basics
================

.. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

A very basic reduction would include a vanadium reference and a sample, without any corrections or position and wavelength calibration, and follow the steps:

#. Reduce vanadium data.

#. Reduce sample data.

#. Run normalisation with vanadium reduction output as input.

.. testsetup:: BasicReduction

   config['default.facility'] = 'ILL'
   config['default.instrument'] = 'D7'
   config.appendDataSearchSubDir('ILL/D7/')

.. testcode:: BasicReduction

    # Define vanadium properties:
    vanadiumProperties = {'FormulaUnits': 1, 'SampleMass': 8.54, 'FormulaUnitMass': 50.94}
    
    # Vanadium reduction
    PolDiffILLReduction(Run='396993', ProcessAs='Vanadium', OutputTreatment='Sum',
	                OutputWorkspace='reduced_vanadium',
                        SampleAndEnvironmentProperties=vanadiumProperties)

    # Define the number of formula units for the sample
    sampleProperties = {'FormulaUnits': 1, 'SampleMass': 2.932, 'FormulaUnitMass': 182.54}
    # Sample reduction
    PolDiffILLReduction(Run='397004', ProcessAs='Sample', OutputWorkspace='reduced_sample',
                            SampleAndEnvironmentProperties=sampleProperties)

    # normalise sample and set the output to absolute units with vanadium
    D7AbsoluteCrossSections(InputWorkspace='reduced_sample', OutputWorkspace='normalised_sample',
                            SampleAndEnvironmentProperties=sampleProperties,
                            NormalisationMethod='Vanadium', VanadiumInputWorkspace='reduced_vanadium')

    SofQ = mtd['normalised_sample']
    xAxis = SofQ[0].readX(0)  # TwoTheta axis
    print('dS/dOmega (TwoTheta) detector position range: {:.2f}...{:.2f} (degrees)'.format(xAxis[0], xAxis[-1]))

Output:

.. testoutput:: BasicReduction

    dS/dOmega (TwoTheta) detector position range: 13.14...144.06 (degrees)

   

Wavelength and position calibration
===================================

The first step of working with D7 data is to ensure that there exist a proper calibration of the wavelength, bank positions, and detector positions relative to their bank. This calibration can be either taken from a previous experiment performed in comparable conditions or obtained from the :math:`\text{Y}_{3}\text{Fe}_{5}\text{O}_{12}` (YIG) scan data using a dedicated algorithm :ref:`D7YIGPositionCalibration <algm-D7YIGPositionCalibration>`. The method follows the description presented in Ref. [#Fennell]_.

This algorithm performs wavelength and position calibration for both individual detectors and detector banks using measurement of a sample of powdered YIG. This data is fitted with Gaussian distributions at the expected peak positions. The output is an :ref:`Instrument Parameter File <InstrumentParameterFile>` readable by the :ref:`LoadILLPolarizedDiffraction <algm-LoadILLPolarizedDiffraction>` algorithm that will place the detector banks and detectors using the output of this algorithm.

The provided YIG d-spacing values are loaded from an XML list. The default d-spacing distribution for YIG is coming from Ref. [#Nakatsuka]_. The peak positions are converted into :math:`2\theta` positions using the initial assumption of the neutron wavelength. YIG peaks in the detector's scan are fitted separately using a Gaussian distribution.

The workspace containing the peak fitting results is then fitted using a `Multidomain` function of the form:

.. math:: 2\theta_{\text{fit}} = m \cdot (2.0 \cdot \text{asin} ( \lambda / 2d ) + offset_{\text{pixel}} + offset_{\text{bank}}),

where `m` is the bank slope, :math:`offset_{\text{pixel}}` is the relative offset to the initial assumption of the position inside the detector bank, and :math:`offset_{\text{bank}}` is the offset of the entire bank. This function allows to extract the information about the wavelength, detector bank slopes and offsets, and the distribution of detector offsets.

It is strongly advised to first run the :ref:`D7YIGPositionCalibration <algm-D7YIGPositionCalibration>` algorithm with the `FittingMethod` set to `None`, so that the initial guesses for the positions of the YIG Bragg peaks can be inspected and corrected if needed.

**Example - D7YIGPositionCalibration - initial guess check before fitting at the shortest wavelength**

.. code-block:: python

   approximate_wavelength = '3.1' # Angstrom
   D7YIGPositionCalibration(Filenames='402652:403041', ApproximateWavelength=approximate_wavelength,
                            YIGPeaksFile='D7_YIG_peaks.xml',
                            MinimalDistanceBetweenPeaks=1.5, BankOffsets=[0,0,0],
                            MaskedBinsRange=[-50, -25, 15], FittingMethod='None', ClearCache=False,
                            FitOutputWorkspace='fitting_test')


**Example - D7YIGPositionCalibration - calibration at the shortest wavelength**

   approximate_wavelength = '3.1' # Angstrom
   D7YIGPositionCalibration(Filenames='402652:403041', ApproximateWavelength=approximate_wavelength,
                               YIGPeaksFile='D7_YIG_peaks.xml', CalibrationOutputFile='test_shortWavelength.xml',
                               MinimalDistanceBetweenPeaks=1.5, BankOffsets=[3,3,-1],

                               FitOutputWorkspace='shortWavelength')

   print('The calibrated wavelength is: {0:.2f}'.format(float(approximate_wavelength)*mtd['shortWavelength'].column(1)[1]))
   print('The bank2 gradient is: {0:.3f}'.format(1.0 / mtd['shortWavelength'].column(1)[0]))
   print('The bank3 gradient is: {0:.3f}'.format(1.0 / mtd['shortWavelength'].column(1)[176]))
   print('The bank4 gradient is: {0:.3f}'.format(1.0 / mtd['shortWavelength'].column(1)[352]))


	     
Transmission calculation
========================

The transmission (T) is calculated using counts measured by monitor 2 (M2), and according to the following formula:

.. math:: T = \frac{S - E_{Cd}}{E - E_{Cd}},

where :math:`S` is M2 counts measured with the current sample, :math:`E_{Cd}` is counts when cadmium absorber is measured, and :math:`E` is counts from the direct beam.

The measurement of the cadmium absorber is optional and does not have to be provided as input for the transmission to be calculated. However, it allows
to take into account dark currents in the readout system electronics and thus this measurement is advised to be included in transmission calculations.

It is possible to provide more than one numor as input for the transmission calculation. In such a case, the input workspaces are averaged.

The output of the transmission calculation is given as a :ref:`WorkspaceGroup <WorkspaceGroup>` with a single workspace containing a single value of the calculated polarisation.

    mtd.clear()


Polarisation correction
=======================

The polarisation correction is estimated using quartz sample. The scattering is purely diffuse and, to a good approximation, non-spin flip.
Ideally, the quartz should have the same geometry and attenuation as the sample as then the same gauge volume of the beam is measured
and the reduction will give an accurate estimation of the polarizing efficiency. However, the correction is usually fairly insensitive to small
differences in the polarizing efficiency and choosing the quartz to have the same outer dimensions is normally satisfactory. Multiple scattering
is not a problem, as the correction is given by a ratio and there is no spin-flip scattering to depolarize the beam. The polarization efficiencies
are calculated from ratios of non-spin-flip to spin-flip scattering, hence absolute numbers are not necessary.

First, the data is normalised to monitor 1 (M1). Then, if the necessary inputs of container and absorber (please note this is a different measurement
than mentioned in the `Transmission` section) measurements are provided, the background can be subtracted from the data: 

.. math:: \dot{I_{B}} = \dot{I} - T\dot{E} - (1-T) \dot{C},

where :math:`\dot{I}` denotes monitor-normalised quartz data, :math:`T` is transmission, and :math:`\dot{E}` and :math:`\dot{C}` are the normalised counts
measured with empty container and cadmium absorber, respectively.

In the case where either absorber or empty container inputs are not provided, this correction is not performed.

Finally, the polariser-analyser efficiency can be calculated, using the following formula:

.. math:: \phi = \frac{\dot{I_{B}}(00) - \dot{I_{B}}(01)}{(2f_{p}-1) \dot{I_{B}}(00) + \dot{I_{B}}(01)},

where :math:`f_{p}` is the flipper efficiency, currently assumed to be 1.0, and :math:`\dot{I_{B}}(00)` and :math:`\dot{I_{B}}(01)` denote normalised
and background-subtracted data with flipper states off and on respectively.

The output is given in as a :ref:`WorkspaceGroup <WorkspaceGroup>` with the number of entries consistent with the number of measured polarisation directions.
Each workspace in the group contains a single value of the polariser-analyser efficiency per detector.

    mtd.clear()


Vanadium data reduction
=======================

Vanadium provides a measure of the relative detector efficiencies and its count rate can be used for the calibration
of sample data to absolute units. Multiple scattering and sample self-attenuation are issues here and the correction
works best if the vanadium has, as close as possible, the same attenuation and shape as the sample.

The scattering from the vanadium is considered to be purely elastic scattering and the cross-section considered to be purely
due to the nuclear spin-incoherent contribution. The reduced vanadium data can be used to normalise the results of the sample
data reduction in :ref:`D7AbsoluteCrossSections <algm-D7AbsoluteCrossSections>`. The vanadium data can also be used as a consistency
check for polarization and multiple scattering corrections.

If the sample has a large nuclear-spin-incoherent cross-section, this separated cross-section can be used as a self-correction for detector
efficiency and even for shape effects from the sample. If the sample stoichiometry is well-known and an accurate estimate for the
nuclear-spin-incoherent cross-section can be derived, this cross-section can be used to express the sample data in absolute units.
In this case, the vanadium cross-section is unnecessary.

For the best results of using the reduced vanadium data as input for sample data normalisation, the `OutputTreatment` property of the
:ref:`PolDiffILLReduction <algm-PolDiffILLReduction>` algorithm needs to be set to `Sum`.


Reduction workflow
------------------

The first two steps of the reduction of vanadium data are the same as for quartz, with normalisation to the monitor and background
subtraction (provided the necessary inputs). The polarisation efficiency of the instrument can be corrected using the previously reduced
quartz data. The correction is applied according to the following formula:

.. math::   \begin{bmatrix}
                \dot{I_{B}}(+) \\
                \dot{I_{B}}(-) \\
            \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2 f_{p} \phi}  \begin{bmatrix}
                                                    (1-\phi)(1-f_{p}) + f_{p}(1+\phi) & -(1-\phi) \\
                                                    -(1+\phi)(1-f_{p}) - f_{p}(1-\phi) & (1+\phi) \\
                                                    \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix}
						                       \dot{I_{B}}(0) \\
								       \dot{I_{B}}(1) \\
								   \end{bmatrix},


where :math:`\dot{I_{B}}(+)` and :math:`\dot{I_{B}}(-)` denote the spin-flip and the non-spin-flip scattering events, respectively,
and :math:`\dot{I_{B}}(0)` and :math:`\dot{I_{B}}(1)` are the events with the flipper state on and off, respectively.

Self-attenuation correction
---------------------------

There are three ways the self-attenuation of a sample can be taken into account in the implemented D7 reduction: `Numerical`, `MonteCarlo`, and `User`.
In all three cases, the correction is applied to data with :ref:`ApplyPaalmanPingsCorrection <algm-ApplyPaalmanPingsCorrection>` algorithm.

The `User` option depends on the self-attenuation parameters provided by the user through `SampleSelfAttenuationFactors` property of the :ref:`PolDiffILLReduction <algm-PolDiffILLReduction>`
algorithm. This option allows to study the self-attenuation of a sample that can have arbitrary shape separately from running the reduction algorithm,
and in more detail if necessary.

On the contrary, The `Numerical` and `MonteCarlo` options calculate the self-attenuation parameters for both the sample and its container during the execution of
the reduction algorithm. These two options depend on Mantid algorithms :ref:`PaalmanPingsAbsorptionCorrection <algm-PaalmanPingsAbsorptionCorrection>`
and :ref:`PaalmanPingsMonteCarloAbsorption <algm-PaalmanPingsMonteCarloAbsorption>`, respectively. These two algorithms require multiple parameters describing
the sample and its environment, such as the geometry, density, and chemical composition to be defined. The communication of these parameters is done
via `SampleAndEnvironmentProperties` property of the :ref:`PolDiffILLReduction <algm-PolDiffILLReduction>` algorithm. All the necessary and accepted keys that
need to be defined for the sample self-attenuation to be properly corrected are described below.

The `SampleAndEnvironmentProperties` property of the :ref:`PolDiffILLReduction <algm-PolDiffILLReduction>` algorithm is a dictionary containing
all of the information about the sample and its environment. This information is used in self-attenuation calculations and also can be reused
in data normalisation in the :ref:`D7AbsoluteCrossSections <algm-D7AbsoluteCrossSections>` algorithm.

The complete list of keys can is summarised below:

Sample-only keys:

- *SampleMass*
- *FormulaUnits*
- *FormulaUnitMass*
- *SampleChemicalFormula*
- *SampleDensity*
- *Height*

The first three keys need to be always defined, so that the number of moles of the sample can be calculated, to ensure proper data normalisation.
All of the density parameters are number density in formula units.

Container-only keys:

- *ContainerChemicalFormula*
- *ContainerDensity*

Beam-only keys:

- *BeamHeight*
- *BeamWidth*

Then, depending on the chosen sample geometry, additional parameters need to be defined:

* For FlatPlate:

  - *SampleThickness*
  - *SampleWidth*
  - *SampleCenter*
  - *SampleAngle*
  - *ContainerFrontThickness*
  - *ContainerBackThickness*

* For Cylinder:

  - *SampleRadius*
  - *ContainerRadius*

* For Annulus:

  - *SampleInnerRadius*
  - *SampleOuterRadius*
  - *ContainerInnerRadius*
  - *ContainerOuterRadius*

Depending on the choice of the self-attenuation method, either `ElementSize` in case of numerical calculations or `EventsPerPoint` for Monte-Carlo method
need to be defined.

Optional keys:

- *InitialEnergy* - if not provided, the value will be calculated from the wavelength in the SampleLogs
- *NMoles* - if not provided, the value will be calculated based on the *SampleMass* and *FormulaUnitMass*


Output
------

The corrected counts in each each detector are normalised to the expected total cross-section for vanadium
of :math:`0.404 \frac{\text{barn}}{\text{steradian} \cdot \text{atom}}`. The output of vanadium reduction
is a :ref:`WorkspaceGroup <WorkspaceGroup>` with one entry if the `OutputTreatment` is set to `Sum`, or
the same number of entries as input data if `Individual` was selected.

In case it is desireable to separate cross-sections, for example for diagnostic purposes, it can be done
using the reduced data described as above using :ref:`D7AbsoluteCrossSections <algm-D7AbsoluteCrossSections>`
algorithm. More details on working with this algorithm are given in the sample normalisation section.

   Vanadium transmission is 0.886
   The vanadium reduction output contains 1 entry with 132 spectra and 1 bin.

    mtd.clear()


Sample data reduction
=====================

The sample data reduction follows the same steps of monitor normalisation, background subtraction, polarisation correction, and
self-attenuation correction as vanadium data reduction. Should the self-attenuation correction be taken into account, the relevant
sample and environment parameters need to be defined in a dictionary that is provided to `SampleAndEnvironmentProperty` with
keys described in the vanadium reduction section.

The output of the  is a :ref:`WorkspaceGroup <WorkspaceGroup>` with the number of entries equal to number of measured polarisations
times number of steps in a :math:`2\theta` scan. This output can be provided to :ref:`D7AbsoluteCrossSections <algm-D7AbsoluteCrossSections>`
for cross-section separation, e.g. for diagnostic purposes, or for the final normalisation.

Cross-section separation
------------------------

The :ref:`D7AbsoluteCrossSections <algm-D7AbsoluteCrossSections>` algorithm allows for either cross-section separation or sample data
normalisation. It is possible to use only one of the possibilities, for example, to separate cross-sections of the reduced vanadium
data without the normalisation subroutines to be invoked. This is especially useful for diagnostic purposes.


The cross-section separation is done according to formulae presented in Ref. [#Sharpf]_ [#Steward]_ [#Ehlers]_. More details on the exact calculations is given in
documentation of the :ref:`D7AbsoluteCrossSections <algm-D7AbsoluteCrossSections>` algorithm. It is possible to perform uniaxial,
6-point (or XYZ), and 10-point measurement separation of magnetic, nuclear coherent, and nuclear-spin-incoherent components of the total
measured scattering cross-section. The specifics of the 10-point measurement as a set of two separate 6-point measurements are taken into account.
In that case, the second set of 6-point data needs to be provided to `RotatedXYZWorkspace` property of the :ref:`D7AbsoluteCrossSections <algm-D7AbsoluteCrossSections>`
algorithm, and the '10-p' needs to be chosen as the `CrossSectionSeparationMethod`.


Sample data normalisation
-------------------------

The output from sample data reduction still needs to be normalised to the relevant standard to set the units to absolute scale.
The normalisation is handled by :ref:`D7AbsoluteCrossSections <algm-D7AbsoluteCrossSections>` algorithm, and there are three
options available to normalise the sample data:

#. Vanadium normalisation

   Uses output from the vanadium data reduction. The units chosen for both the sample and vanadium data during reduction should agree.

#. Paramagnetic normalisation

   This normalisation approach uses the output from the cross-section separation to set the sample output to absolute units. An additional parameter
   needs to be defined in the sample properties dictionary, named `SampleSpin`, to define the spin of the sample.


#. Spin-incoherent normalisation

   This normalisation approach also uses the output from the cross-section separation. If the goal is to set the output data to absolute scale,
   an additional parameter needs to be defined in the sample properties dictionary, named `IncoherentCrossSection`, to provide the total
   nuclear-spin-incoherent cross-section of the sample.

In all cases, a relative normalisation to the detector with highest number of counts is always performed.

Output
------

The output of the reduction and normalisation is a :ref:`WorkspaceGroup <WorkspaceGroup>` with the number of entries consistent with the input
if the `OutputTreatment` property was selected to be `Individual`, or the number of entries will be consistent with either the number of polarisation
orientations present in the data (e.g. six for a XYZ method) or the number of separated cross-section.
Each entry of the output group is a workspace with X-axis unit being either momentum exchange :math:`Q` or the scattering angle :math:`2\theta`.
