Description
-----------

Algorithm written using the paper referenced below which has a very good
description.

This algorithm estimates the background level and separates the background
from signal data in a Poisson-distributed data set by statistical analysis.
For each iteration, the bins/points with the highest intensity value are
eliminated from the data set and the sample mean and the unbiased variance
estimator are calculated. Convergence is reached when the absolute
difference between the sample mean and the sample variance of the data set
is within k standard deviations of the variance, the default value of k
being 1. The k value is called ``SigmaConstant`` in the algorithm input.
