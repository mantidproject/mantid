Description
-----------


POLDI is a pulse overlap diffractometer and therefore the arrival time of a neutron does not uniquely determine
the time-of-flight of the neutron (and hence the d-spacing in a given detector). Neutrons of different wavelength can
arrive at the same time having passed through the chopper in a different pulse/slit.
Indeed, neutrons corresponding to the same d-spacing are observed at many different arrival times in a given detector
due to the overlapping pulses measured.

The output of PoldiAutoCorrelation is a correlation spectrum, similar to the spectrum of a conventional TOF
diffractometer. Bragg reflections will appear in this correlation spectrum as peaks surrounded by a dip in the background.
The positions of the Bragg peaks can be determined to a high accuracy in the correlation spectrum and indexed
accordingly.

PoldiAutoCorrelation performs a type of average of the intensity over different arrival times from
each pulse corresponding to a given d-spacing for each detector: the correlation intensity at a given
d-spacing is the inverse of the sum of the inverse intensities at each possible arrival time (see Eq. 8 in [1]_).
A high correlation intensity implies a consistently high intensity was measured at all arrival times due to all
possible chopper openings/pulses.

Note by convention the correlation spectrum is converted from d-spacing into momentum transfer.

Further details of the POLDI instrument and the reduction can be found in [1]_.

Usage
-----

Note POLDI 1.2 is still under development, the data are currently saved in ASCII format with no meta-data required
for the reduction. Currently there is a helper function ``load_poldi`` that reads the ASCII file, loads an instrument
definition and adds the appropriate meta-data to the workspace.

.. testcode:: POLDI_silicon_autocorr

    from mantid.simpleapi import *
    from mantid.api import FileFinder
    from plugins.algorithms.poldi_utils import load_poldi

    fpath_data = FileFinder.getFullPath("poldi_448x500_chopper5k_silicon.txt")
    fpath_idf = FileFinder.getFullPath("POLDI_Definition_448_calibrated.xml")

    # load the raw data
    ws = load_poldi(fpath_data, fpath_idf, chopper_speed=5000, t0=5.855e-02, t0_const=-9.00)
    print(f"The workspace contains {ws.getNumberHistograms()} spectra.")

    ws_corr = PoldiAutoCorrelation(InputWorkspace=ws, OutputWorkspace='ws_corr')
    print(f"The correlation spectrum has {ws_corr.blocksize()} bins.")

Output:

.. testoutput:: POLDI_silicon_autocorr

    The workspace contains 448 spectra.
    The correlation spectrum has 2460 bins.
