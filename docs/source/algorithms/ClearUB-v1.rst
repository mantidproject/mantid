Description
-----------

Clears the OrientedLattice of each ExperimentInfo attached to the intput
`Workspace <http://www.mantidproject.org/Workspace>`_. Works with both single ExperimentInfos and
MultipleExperimentInfo instances.

Usage 
-----

.. testcode:: ExClearUB

   # create a workspace (or you can load one)
   ws=CreateSingleValuedWorkspace(5)

   #set a UB matrix using the vector along k_i as 1,1,0, and the 0,0,1 vector in the horizontal plane
   SetUB(ws,a=5,b=6,c=7,alpha=90, beta=90, gamma=90, u="1,1,0", v="0,0,1")

   #check that we do have a UB matrix
   from numpy import *
   mat=array(ws.sample().getOrientedLattice().getUB())
   print("UB matrix size {}".format(mat.size ))

   ClearUB(ws)

   #check that it removed UB matrix & orientated lattice
   if( ws.sample().hasOrientedLattice() ):
	print("ClearUB has not removed the orientated lattice.")
   else:
	print("ClearUB has removed the oriented lattice.")

Output:

.. testoutput:: ExClearUB

   UB matrix size 9
   ClearUB has removed the oriented lattice.
