Description
-----------

This algorithm allows the user to set the MDFrame type for each axis on a workspace. 
The algorithm makes it possible to introduce the correct MDFrame type to 
workspaces which are associated with legacy files. Note that this can only be applied 
to MDHisto and MDEvent workspaces.

The selectable frame types are:
- "QLab" for a QLab-based frame
- "QSample" for a QSample-based frame
- "HKL" for an HKL-based frame
- "General Frame" for a general purpose frame
- "Unknown frame" when the frame type is unknown

One frame-type is selected and applied to several dimensions which are specified by
a Numpy-style array selection.

Usage
-----

**Example - Sample usage of SetMDFrame**

.. testcode:: SetMDFrameExample

    # Prepare the sample workspace
    mdws = CreateMDWorkspace(Dimensions=3, Extents='-10,10,-10,10,-10,10', 
                                        Names='A,B,C', Units='U,U,U', 
                                        Frames='QSample, QSample, QSample')
    print("The first MDFrame is of type " + mdws.getDimension(0).getMDFrame().name())
    print("The second MDFrame is of type " + mdws.getDimension(1).getMDFrame().name())
    print("The third MDFrame is of type " + mdws.getDimension(2).getMDFrame().name())

    # Set the 0th and 2nd frame to QLab
    SetMDFrame(mdws,MDFrame='QLab', Axes=[0,2])

    print("The new first MDFrame is of type " + mdws.getDimension(0).getMDFrame().name())
    print("The second MDFrame is of type " + mdws.getDimension(1).getMDFrame().name())
    print("The new third MDFrame is of type " + mdws.getDimension(2).getMDFrame().name())

Output:

.. testoutput:: SetMDFrameExample

    The first MDFrame is of type QSample
    The second MDFrame is of type QSample
    The third MDFrame is of type QSample
    The new first MDFrame is of type QLab
    The second MDFrame is of type QSample
    The new third MDFrame is of type QLab
