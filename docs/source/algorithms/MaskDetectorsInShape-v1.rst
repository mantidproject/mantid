Description
-----------

Masks detectors that are contained within a user defined 3 dimensional
shape within the instrument.

The algorithm places the user defined geometric shape within the virtual
instrument and masks any detector detectors that in contained within it.
A detector is considered to be contained it its central location point
is contained within the shape.

:ref:`This page <HowToDefineGeometricShape>`
provides a description of the syntax of ShapeXML string.

ChildAlgorithms used
####################

MaskDetectorsInShape runs the following algorithms as child algorithms:

-  :ref:`algm-FindDetectorsInShape` - To determine the
   detectors that are contained in the user defined shape.
-  :ref:`algm-MaskDetectors` - To mask the detectors found.


Usage

.. testcode::

  # Create a workspace
  ws = CreateSampleWorkspace()

  # Define an infinite cylinder with its axis parallel to the Z-axis
  # and the radius of 0.04
  shapeXML = \
  """
  <infinite-cylinder id="A" >
      <centre x="0" y="0" z="0" />
      <axis x="0" y="0" z="1" />
      <radius val="0.04" />
  </infinite-cylinder>
  """
  # Mask all detectors inside this cylinder
  MaskDetectorsInShape( ws, shapeXML )

  #Check the result
  masked_dets =  []
  inside_dets = []
  # Collect separately all masked detector IDs and IDs of detectors
  # that are inside the cylinder defined by shapeXML
  R2 = 0.04**2 # cylinder radius sqared
  for i in range(ws.getNumberHistograms()):
    det = ws.getDetector(i)
    if det.isMasked():
      masked_dets.append( det.getID() )
    r = det.getPos()
    if r.X()**2 + r.Y()**2 <= R2:
      inside_dets.append( det.getID() )

  # Print out the IDs
  print(masked_dets)
  print(inside_dets)

  # Check that the two arrays are equal
  print(masked_dets == inside_dets)
