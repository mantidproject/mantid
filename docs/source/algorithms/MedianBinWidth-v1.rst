Description
-----------

This algorithm calculates the median bin width of each histogram in *InputWorkspace*. The (optionally rounded) mean value of the medians is then placed in the *BinWidth* output property.

Rounding
########

If the *Rounding* property is set to **10^n**, the bin width will be rounded down to the nearest power of 10. For example, 0.11 and 0.99 will be rounded to 0.1, while 0.011 and 0.099 will be rounded to 0.01.

Restrictions on properties
################################

The *InputWorkspace* has to contain histogram data. For point data, :ref:`algm-ConvertToHistogram` can be used first, but care should be taken if the points are not equally spaced.

Usage
-----

**Example: rebinning a workspace.**

.. testcode:: Example

    import numpy

    # For normal python lists: 3 * [0.1] = [0.1, 0.1, 0.1]
    binWidths = 3 * [0.1] + 4 * [1.7] + [10.0]
    # Convert to numpy array.
    # For numpy arrays: 3 * [0.1] = [0.3], thus the above magic would not work.
    binWidhts = numpy.array(binWidths)
    # Make bin boundaries out of the widths. The first boundary is at -3.0.
    xs = numpy.cumsum(numpy.append(numpy.array([-3.0]), binWidths))
    # There is one less bin than the number of boundaries.
    ys = numpy.zeros(len(xs) - 1)
    ws = CreateWorkspace(DataX=xs, DataY=ys)

    newWidth = MedianBinWidth(InputWorkspace=ws)
    print('New bin width: {0}'.format(newWidth))

    rebinned = Rebin(InputWorkspace=ws, Params=[newWidth], FullBinsOnly=True)

    widths = ws.readX(0)[1:] - ws.readX(0)[:-1]
    print('Bin widths before rebinning: {0}'.format(widths))
    widths = rebinned.readX(0)[1:] - rebinned.readX(0)[:-1]
    print('Bin widths after rebinning: {0}'.format(widths))

Output:

.. testoutput:: Example

    New bin width: 1.7
    Bin widths before rebinning: [  0.1   0.1   0.1   1.7   1.7   1.7   1.7  10. ]
    Bin widths after rebinning: [ 1.7  1.7  1.7  1.7  1.7  1.7  1.7  1.7  1.7  1.7]
