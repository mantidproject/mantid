Description
-----------

Calculates a measure of the goodness of a fit in four ways.

The ChiSquared property returns the sum of squares of differences between the calculated and measured values:

:math:`\chi_{1}^{2} = \sum_{i} (y_i - f_i)^2`

where :math:`y_i` and :math:`f_i` are the measured and calculated values at i-th point.

The ChiSquaredDividedByDOF is ChiSquared divided by the number of degrees of freedom (DOF):

:math:`\chi_{2}^{2} = \frac{1}{DOF}\sum_{i} (y_i - f_i)^2`

:math:`DOF = N_d - N_p` where :math:`N_d` is the number of data points used in fitting and :math:`N_p`
is the number of free (not fixed or tied) parameters of the function.

The ChiSquaredWeighted property sums the squares of the differences divided by the data errors:

:math:`\chi_{3}^{2} = \sum_{i} \left(\frac{y_i - f_i}{\sigma_i}\right)^2`

Finally, ChiSquaredWeightedDividedByDOF is

:math:`\chi_{4}^{2} = \chi_{3}^{2} / DOF`

Parameter errors
================

Setting the Output property to a non-empty string makes the algorithm explore the surface of the :math:`\chi^{2}`
around its minimum and estimate the standard deviations for the parameters. The value of the property is a base name
for two output table workspaces: '<Output>_errors' and '<Output>_pdf'. The former workspace contains parameter error
estimates and the latter shows :math:`\chi^{2}`'s 1d slices along each parameter (keeping all other fixed).

The error table has the following columns:

===============    ===========
Column             Description
===============    ===========
Parameter          Parameter name
Value              Parameter value passed with the Function property
Value at Min       The minimum point of the 1d slice of the :math:`\chi^{2}`. If the Function is at the minimum then
                   Value at Min should be equal to Value.
Left Error         The negative deviation from the minimum point equivalent to :math:`1\sigma`. Estimated from analisys
                   of the surface.
Right Error        The positive deviation from the minimum point equivalent to :math:`1\sigma`. Estimated from analisys
                   of the surface.
Quadratic Error    :math:`1\sigma` standard deviation in the quadratic approximation of the surface.
Chi2 Min           The value of :math:`\chi^{2}` at the minimum relative to the test point.
===============    ===========

The pdf table contains slices of the :math:`\chi^{2}` along each parameter. It has 3 column per parameter. The first column of the 3
is the parameter values, the second has the :math:`\chi^{2}` and the third is the probability density function normalised to
have 1 at the maximum.

    # Create a data set
    x = np.linspace(0,1,10)
    y = 1.0 + 2.0 * x
    e = np.sqrt(y)

    # Define a function

    # Calculate the chi squared
    chi2,chi2dof,chi2W,chi2Wdof = CalculateChiSquared(func,ws)

    print 'Chi squared is %s' % chi2
    print 'Chi squared / DOF is %s' % chi2dof
    print 'Chi squared weighted is %s' % chi2W
    print 'Chi squared weighted / DOF is %s' % chi2Wdof
    print 

    # Define a function that models the data exactly
    func = 'name=LinearBackground,A0=1.0,A1=2.0'

    # Calculate the chi squared
    chi2,chi2dof,chi2W,chi2Wdof = CalculateChiSquared(func,ws)

**Example 2**

.. testcode::
    
    import numpy as np
    # Create a workspace and fill it with some gaussian data and some noise

    fun = fun_t % (1, 0, 1)
    # Test the chi squared.
    CalculateChiSquared(fun,ws,Output='Test0')
    # Check the Test0_errors table and see that the parameters are not at minimum

    # Fit the function
    res = Fit(fun,ws,Output='out')
    # res[3] is a table with the fitted parameters
    nParams = res[3].rowCount() - 1
    params = [res[3].cell(i,1) for i in range(nParams)]
    # Build a new function and populate it with the fitted parameters
    fun = fun_t % tuple(params)
