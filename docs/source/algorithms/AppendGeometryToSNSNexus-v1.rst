Description
-----------

This algorithm is intended to append the geometry information into a raw
NeXus file. It is initially for use only at the SNS, as it is needed for
the currently upgrade program. But there is nothing preventing it being
used elsewhere.

The algorithm takes the geometry information in the IDF together with the
log values in a given NeXus file and calculates the resolved positions
of all the detectors and then writes this into the NeXus file specified.

Usage
-----

This a currently a Proof of Concept algorithm.  If it matures into normal use a usage example must be added.
