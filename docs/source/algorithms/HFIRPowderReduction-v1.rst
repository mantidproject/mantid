Description
-----------

This algorithm is used to reduce powder diffraction data from the HFIR instruments at ORNL. It is a
workflow algorithm that uses several other algorithms to perform the reduction. The input data can be
specified either as a list of files or as an IPTS number and a list of run numbers. This works for both WAND and MIDAS instruments.
