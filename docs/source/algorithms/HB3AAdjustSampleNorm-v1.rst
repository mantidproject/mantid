Description
-----------

Takes in DEMAND detector scan data from files or workspaces and converts them to Q-space, providing an optional
adjustment of the detector positions. `DetectorHeightOffset` adjusts all banks along the y-axis, and
`DetectorDistanceOffset` adjusts banks along the z-axis. Both parameters move the detector relative to the current
detector position.

The output can be either an :ref:`MDEventWorkspace <MDWorkspace>` or a
:ref:`MDHistoWorkspace <MDHistoWorkspace>`. For a `MDHistoWorkspace,`
the conversion to Q-space is done using :ref:`ConvertWANDSCDtoQ
<algm-ConvertWANDSCDtoQ>` while :ref:`ConvertHFIRSCDtoMDE
<algm-ConvertHFIRSCDtoMDE>` is used for outputting an
`MDEventWorkspace.`

If multiple data file are included then the output will be a
:ref:`WorkspaceGroup <WorkspaceGroup>` containing all the
:ref:`MDWorkspaces <MDWorkspace>`.

Normalisation
-------------

During loading a few different types of normalisation can be applied,
vanadium, time or monitor and motor step size. `VanadiumFile` or
`VanadiumWorkspace` is applied by dividing the data detector
pixel-by-pixel. The `NormaliseBy` option `time` or `monitor` uses that
log values from the data (and vanadium if used) input and is applied
to each scan axis step. The `ScaleByMotorStep` scales the entire data
by the step size of either the `omega` or `chi` axis, this is only
using when converting to Q-sample and allows the comparison of peak
intensities found with :ref:`IntegratePeaksMD <algm-IntegratePeaksMD>`
to be directly compared between scans measured with different step
sizes.

See :ref:`HB3AIntegratePeaks <algm-HB3AIntegratePeaks>` for complete examples of the HB3A workflow.
