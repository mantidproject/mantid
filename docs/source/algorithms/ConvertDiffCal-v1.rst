Description
-----------

Generates a :ref:`calibration table <DiffractionCalibrationWorkspace>` based on
d-spacing detector offsets provided in an OffsetsWorkspace. Optionally updates
detector calibrations from an existing calibration file. Each detector
offset in the OffsetsWorkspace is processed as follows:

If the detector is masked, its :math:`DIFC` will not be calculated or updated.

If a PreviousCalibration entry exists for the detector, the detector entry's
:math:`DIFC` will be updated as follows and reflected in the final calibration table:

.. math:: DIFC_{new} = \frac{DIFC_{old}}{1+offset}

If a prior calibration entry does not exist for the detector, calculate the :math:`DIFC`
as follows using geometry of the experiment:

.. math:: DIFC = \frac{1}{1+offset}\frac{2m_N}{h} L_{tot} sin \theta

If a detector is present in the PreviousCalibration table but is not found in the
OffsetsWorkspace, it will be propagated to the output calibration table unchanged.
