Description
-----------

IndexSatellitePeaks is used to find the higher dimensional miller indices that
index a collection of "satellite" fractional single crystal peaks. This
algorithm takes a PeaksWorkspace, output from the algorithm
FindSatellitePeaks, and returns a new table with integer indices for each
peak.

This algorithm works by first attempting to finding the minimum number of
distinct modulation (`q`) vectors that are required to fully index the
collection of peaks. The full list of q vectors is found using the same method
described in the :ref:`FindSatellitePeaks <algm-FindSatellitePeaks-v1>`
algorithm. The basis set is then chosen from this list. If there are multiple
choices of vectors the algorithm will always choose the smallest one. This
defines the number of additional dimensions required to index the crystal with
integer indices. 

Once a basis of `q` vectors has been chosen for indexing the system all integer
multiples of the basis set are generated. Each `q` vector is then compared with
the set of all possible integer reflections and is assigned to the closest one
found within the radius of the `Tolerance` parameter (measured by Euclidean
distance in HKL space). Reflections which cannot be indexed within the
tolerance are set to (0,0,0).

.. warning:: The current version of the algorithm returns a
    :ref:`TableWorkspace <Table Workspaces>` and not a :ref:`PeaksWorkspace
    <PeaksWorkspace>`. This means that the workspace cannot be overlaid on the
    slice viewer or the instrument view. 

.. seealso:: As well as being able to export the data to the nexus file format,
    saving the data to the Jana format is supported via the :ref:`SaveReflections
    <algm-SaveReflections-v1>` algorithm.

**Example - calling IndexSatellitePeaks:**

.. testcode:: IndexSatellitePeaks

    import numpy as np
    np.random.seed(1)

    nuclear_peaks = Load('WISH_peak_hkl_small.nxs')
    satellite_peaks = Load("refine_satellites_fixed_q_test.nxs")
    indexed_peaks = IndexSatellitePeaks(nuclear_peaks, satellite_peaks, tolerance=0.1, NumOfQs=2)
    index_values = np.array(indexed_peaks.column("m1"))

    for peak in indexed_peaks:
        print("H: {h:>5} K: {k:>5} L: {l:>5} M1: {m1:>5}".format(**peak))

Output:
