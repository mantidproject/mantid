Description
-----------
Performs the reduction of pelican data from event data (two theta, time) to S(Q,w) for single crystal data.  The algorithm
will sequentially perform the :ref:`PelicanReduction <algm-PelicanReduction>` processing for all run numbers provided.
The data is output in nxspe format and can be used by programs such as Horace to process single crystal
inelastic neutron scattering data.
