Description
-----------

The algorithm takes every pixel defined in the SQW horace file and
converts it into an event.

Only top level binning information is currently taken from DND/Image
data. All DND image information is currently ignored and the resulting
MDEvent workspace is in the units of :math:`Q^{-1}` (SQW dimensions,
recalculated to the Crystal? frame, without HKL transformation).

U matrix is set to unity but the B-matrix is read from the SQW and
attached to the workspace which may confuse the algorithms which work
with :ref:`MDEventWorkspace <MDWorkspace>` produced by Mantid
algorithms.

Notes on Horace SQW files
#########################

Sqw objects comes in two flavours:

- sqw-type

- dnd-type

The former has the four main fields fully filled. The fields description
is given below. The latter has:

- **main\_header**, **header**, **detpar** as empty structures (0x0 struct array with no fields)

- data.urange and data.pix do not exist.

The dnd-type is created from d0d, d1d,... objects for most algorithms so
as to use private methods of sqw objects.

DND-type object can not be currently read or understood by Mantid.

The pixel projection axes, u1, u2, u3 are the orthonormal vectors of the
crystal Cartesian coordinate frame i.e. u1 \|\| a\*, u2 in plane of a\*,
and b\*, and u3 \|\| a\* x b\*. They form the coordinate frame in which
the pixel coordinates are stored in data.pix. The pixel projection axes
must necessarily be identical for all contributing spe files.

General notes about SQW file assumptions
########################################

Parts of the code were written with the idea of generalising
functionality at a later stage. However, we can now assume that:

- the lattice parameters are all the same for all contributing spe files
- the energy offset is zero in cuts
- requires that all sqw files that are to be combined have
  #.   each been created from only one spe file
  #.   the same lattice parameters and pixel projection axes as held in the header block
  #.   the same projection axes and offsets, as held in the data block
  #.   the same plot and integration axes, with same bins and integration ranges
- the display axes will be taken from the first sqw object in the list to be combined

Usage
-----
.. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

**Example - Load 4D workspace form sample SQW file.**

.. testcode:: ExLoadSQW

   # Delete existing workspace if it is already in Mantid as LoadSQW does not support overwriting
   # existig workspaces by design
   if 'mdws' in mtd:
       DeleteWorkspace('mdws')
   #
   # Load sample sqw file, present in Mantid unit tests as MD workspace
   mdws = LoadSQW('test_horace_reader.sqw');

   # Check results
   print("Workspace type is:  {}".format(mdws.id()))
   print("Workspace has:{0:2} dimensions and contains: {1:4} MD events".format(mdws.getNumDims(),mdws.getNEvents()))

Output:

.. testoutput:: ExLoadSQW

   Workspace type is:  MDEventWorkspace<MDEvent,4>
   Workspace has: 4 dimensions and contains:  580 MD events
