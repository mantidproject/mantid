Description
-----------

The algorithm takes a measured flood run (or runs) and converts it to a workspace that can be used for flood correction of reflectometry measurements.
If `StartSpectrumIndex1 and `EndSpectrumIndex` are given then they specify a range of detectors for which the flood will be calculated, for all other
detectors it will be assumed 1. For detectors given in the `Exclude` property the flood value will be set to a very large number that will have an effect 
of excluding these detectors from analysis. `Background` specifies the function to use to remove the background and scale the flood values. The output
workspace shares the instrument with the inputs but not the logs.
