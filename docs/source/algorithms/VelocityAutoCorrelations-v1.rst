Description
------------
Loads a netcdf file generated by nMoldyn containing MMTK format trajectories. The algorithm calculates, sums and averages velocity auto-correlations of every type of particle. The correlations are not properly scaled with incoherent scattering lengths as of version 1.0.

Example
------------
Velocity auto-correlations calculated for sodium fluoride.
