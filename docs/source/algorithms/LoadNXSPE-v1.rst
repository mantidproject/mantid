Description
-----------

Algorithm to load an NXSPE file into a workspace2D. It will create a new
instrument, that can be overwritten later by the LoadInstrument
algorithm.

**NOTE:** In the current implementation, the rendering of the NXSPE
instrument is VERY memory intensive.

Usage
-----

See :ref:`algm-SaveNXSPE` usage examples where Save and Load NXSPE operations are tested together.
