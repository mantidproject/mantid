Description
-----------

The LoadSINQFocus algorithm loads a file containing data from the Instrument `FOCUS`_ at SINQ. The data is stored in a MatrixWorkspace. The algorithm automatically loads the instrument definition.

Please note that this algorithm has been declared obsolete. The data may be loaded with the more recent :ref:`algm-LoadSINQFile` algorithm.

.. _FOCUS: http://www.psi.ch/sinq/focus

Usage
-----

.. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

The following example script loads a data file obtained at the FOCUS instrument and prints some information about the obtained workspace.

.. testcode :: ExFocus

    # Load FOCUS data
    focus_2906 = LoadSINQFocus('focus2014n002906.hdf')

    # Print out some information
    print("Sample title: {}".format(focus_2906.getTitle()))
    print("Number of spectra: {}".format(focus_2906.getNumberHistograms()))

Output:

.. testoutput:: ExFocus

    Sample title: water at 320K
    Number of spectra: 375


Creating a color fill plot of the resulting workspace should result in an image similar to the one below.
