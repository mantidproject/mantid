   LET converted to X and Y

Description
-----------

This converts the workspace into a 2D view of real space detector positions based on the detector positions.  This is intended for rapid visualization and has been optimized for speed for use in Live data streams.
If the data provided has data binned in Time of flight or any other unit this will be integrated into a single value per detector, before converting to the selected detector and rebinning to the new grid.
The output grid is based in the maximum and minimum values of the detectors for axes selected, and the number of bins selected.  The rebinning is simply based on centre point rebinning,
and as such can be prone to moire based artefacts, however it is fast.

As the rebinning approach is simple centre point rebinning then the quality of the final plot is sensitive to the number of bins selected for each axis, too many will cause gaps between the detectors, and too few will cause overlap in certain bins.

**Example - ConvertAxesToRealSpace**

.. testcode:: ConvertAxesToRealSpaceExample

	ws = CreateSampleWorkspace(BankPixelWidth=20)
	#move the 2nd bank to a better position
	MoveInstrumentComponent(ws,"bank2",X=0.2,Z=-5,RelativePosition=True)

	wsOut = ConvertAxesToRealSpace(ws,"y","2theta",20,20)

	# Print the result
	print("The output workspace has axes of {} with {} bins".format(wsOut.getAxis(1).getUnit().caption(), wsOut.getNumberHistograms()))
	print("and {} with {} bins.".format(wsOut.getAxis(0).getUnit().caption(), wsOut.blocksize()))

Output:

.. testoutput:: ConvertAxesToRealSpaceExample

	The output workspace has axes of y with 20 bins
	and 2theta with 20 bins.
