**This algorithm is meant for developers only!**

This algorithm is used for performance testing and debugging of nexus
saving and loading.

If you specify ``SaveFilename`` (optional), then the algorithm will save a
file with the given number of chunks of the given size.

If you specify ``LoadFilename`` (optional), then the algorithm will load
back a file created with this algorithm.

The ``SaveSpeed`` and ``LoadSpeed`` output properties are set to the saving
and loading rates, in MB per second.
