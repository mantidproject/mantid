Description
-----------

Converts a 2D workspace in :ref:`units <Unit Factory>`
of spectrum number/**energy transfer** to
the intensity as a function of momentum transfer
:math:`Q` and energy transfer :math:`\Delta E`.

The rebinning is done as a weighted sum of overlapping polygons. The polygon
in :math:`Q-\Delta E` space is calculated from the energy bin boundaries and
the detector scattering angle :math:`2\theta`. The detectors (pixels) are
assumed to be uniform, and characterised by a single angular width
:math:`\Delta2\theta`. This is calculated from the nominal :math:`2\theta` of
each detector; this algorithm does not utilize the `DetectorTwoThetaRanges`
optional input property. The signal and error of the rebinned data (in
:math:`Q-\Delta E` space) is then the sum of the contributing pixels in each
bin weighted by their fractional overlap area. Unlike the more precise
:ref:`algm-SofQWNormalisedPolygon` algorithm, these fractional weights are not
thereafter retained in the workspace produced by this algorithm.

See :ref:`algm-SofQWCentre` for centre-point binning.
Alternatively, see :ref:`algm-SofQWNormalisedPolygon` for a
more complex and precise (but slower) binning strategy, where the actual
detector shape is calculated to obtain the input polygon.

Usage
-----

**Example - simple transformation of inelastic workspace:**

.. testcode:: SofQWPolygon

   # create sample inelastic workspace for MARI instrument containing 1 at all spectra values
   ws=CreateSimulationWorkspace(Instrument='MAR',BinParams='-10,1,10')
   # convert workspace into MD workspace
   ws=SofQWPolygon(InputWorkspace=ws,QAxisBinning='-3,0.1,3',Emode='Direct',EFixed=12)

   print("The converted X-Y values are:")
   Xrow=ws.readX(59);
   Yrow=ws.readY(59);
   line1= " ".join('! {0:>6.2f} {1:>6.2f} '.format(Xrow[i],Yrow[i]) for i in range(0,10))
   print(line1 + " !")
   line2= " ".join('! {0:>6.2f} {1:>6.2f} '.format(Xrow[i],Yrow[i]) for i in range(10,20))
   print(line2 + " !")
   print('! {0:>6.2f} ------- !'.format(Xrow[20]))



.. testcleanup:: SofQWPolygon

   DeleteWorkspace(ws)

**Output:**

.. testoutput:: SofQWPolygon
