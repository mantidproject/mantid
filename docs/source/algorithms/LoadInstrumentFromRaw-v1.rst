Description
-----------

Attempts to load information about the instrument from a ISIS raw file. In
particular, attempts to  read L2 and 2-theta detector position values and
add detectors which are positioned relative to the sample in spherical
coordinates as (r,theta,phi)=(L2,2-theta,0.0). Also adds dummy source and
samplepos components to instrument.

LoadInstrumentFromRaw is intended to be used as a child algorithm of
other Load algorithms, rather than being used directly.

Usage
-----

**Example - Saving Some Pre-existing Data**

.. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

.. testcode:: Ex

   # Create a dummy ws containing arbitrary data, into which we will load the instrument.
   ws = CreateSampleWorkspace("Histogram","Flat background")

   det_id_list = LoadInstrumentFromRaw(ws, "LOQ48127.raw")

   inst = ws.getInstrument()

   print("The name of the instrument is '{}'.".format(inst.getName().strip()))
   print("The position of the source is {}.".format(inst.getSource().getPos()))
   print("The position of detector 5 is {}.".format(inst.getDetector(5).getPos()))
   print("Is detector 1 a monitor? {}".format(inst.getDetector(1).isMonitor()))
   print("Is detector 8 a monitor? {}".format(inst.getDetector(8).isMonitor()))

Output:

.. testoutput:: Ex

   The name of the instrument is 'LOQ'.
   The position of the source is [0,0,-11].
   The position of detector 5 is [0,0,-11.15].
   Is detector 1 a monitor? True
   Is detector 8 a monitor? False
