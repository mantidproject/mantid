Description
-----------

The algorithm loads a BOA file using :ref:`algm-LoadSINQ`. It produces three output workspaces, histogram *N*, ysum *N* and psdsum *N*, where *N* is the numor supplied to ViewBOA.

histogram *N* contains the wavelength spectrum and can be plotted using "Plot spectrum...". The other two workspaces can be inspected with the spectrum slice viewer. psdsum *N* shows a beam profile on the two-dimensional detector, whereas ysum *N* shows the distribution of events with TOF on the x-axis and the detector x-coordinate on the y-axis, as indicated in the three images below (histogram, psdsum and ysum from left to right).

Usage
-----

.. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

The following code loads a BOA file and prints out information about the wavelength distribution of the neutrons.

.. testcode:: ViewBOAEx

    import numpy as np

    ViewBOA(2014, 61, 6)

    lamdba_distribution = mtd['histogram61'].readY(0)
    lambda_values = mtd['histogram61'].readX(0)

    print("The wavelength spectrum is described by {} points.".format(len(lamdba_distribution)))
    print("The range covered is {0} - {1} Angstrom.".format(round(lambda_values[0], 4),round(lambda_values[-1], 4)))
    print("The maximum is located at {} Angstrom.".format(round(lambda_values[np.argmax(lamdba_distribution)], 4)))

This script leads to the following output:

.. testoutput:: ViewBOAEx

    The wavelength spectrum is described by 400 points.
    The range covered is 0.7912 - 8.6638 Angstrom.
    The maximum is located at 2.3894 Angstrom.

In addition, the three workspaces described above are available, plotting them should produce figures like the above.
