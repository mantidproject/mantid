Description
-----------
Compute the detector sensitivity of SANS data. This algorithm is used by
the EQSANS and HFIR SANS reduction.

The flood is a short for flood field. The flood field is collected from a 
sample that scatters uniformly in angle to ensure that every pixel on the 
detector has the potential to see the same number of neutrons.  
Different materials are currently used at the beamlines to measure the flood 
field.  At present, the standard samples used for measuring the flood field 
are H2O in a 1 mm path length cell for GP-SANS and Bio-SANS, and a 1 mm sheet 
of PMMA for EQ-SANS.

The relative detector sensitivity is computed the following way

:math:`S(x,y)=\frac{I_{flood}(x,y)}{1/N_{pixels}\sum_{i,j}I_{flood}(i,j)}`

where :math:`I_{flood}(x,y)` is the pixel count of the flood data in pixel (x,y). 
If a minimum and/or maximum sensitivity is given, the pixels having an 
sensitivity outside the given limits are set to `-inf` (In Mantid `EMPTY_DBL`).

.. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

**Example - Compute the detector sensitivity from a BioSANS data file:**

.. testcode:: ExEff

   # Load your data file
   workspace = LoadSpice2D('BioSANS_empty_cell.xml')
   
   # Compute the detector sensitivity
   sensitivity = CalculateSensitivity('workspace', MinThreshold=0.5, MaxThreshold=1.5)
