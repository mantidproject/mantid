Description
-----------

Stitches single histogram :ref:`Matrix Workspaces <MatrixWorkspace>`
together outputting a stitched Matrix Workspace. This algorithm is a
wrapper over :ref:`algm-Stitch1D`.

The algorithm expects pairs of StartOverlaps and EndOverlaps values. The
order in which these are provided determines the pairing. There should
be N entries in each of these StartOverlaps and EndOverlaps lists, where
N = 1 -(No of workspaces to stitch). StartOverlaps and EndOverlaps are
in the same units as the X-axis for the workspace and are optional.

The workspaces must be histogrammed. Use
:ref:`algm-ConvertToHistogram` on workspaces prior to
passing them to this algorithm.

This algorithm is also capable of stitching together matrix workspaces
from multiple workspace groups. In this case, each group must contain the
same number of workspaces. The algorithm will stitch together the workspaces
in the first group before stitching workspaces from the next group on top
of the previous ones.

Usage
-----
**Example - a basic example using Stitch1DMany to stitch three workspaces together.**

.. testcode:: ExStitch1DManySimple

    import numpy as np

    def gaussian(x, mu, sigma):
      """Creates a gaussian peak centered on mu and with width sigma."""
      return (1/ sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) * np.exp( - (x-mu)**2  / (2*sigma**2))

    # Create three histograms with a single peak in each one
    x1 = np.arange(-1, 1, 0.02)
    x2 = np.arange(0.4, 1.6, 0.02)
    x3 = np.arange(1.3, 3, 0.02)
    ws1 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x1, DataY=gaussian(x1[:-1], 0, 0.1)+1)
    ws2 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x2, DataY=gaussian(x2[:-1], 1, 0.05)+1)
    ws3 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x3, DataY=gaussian(x3[:-1], 2, 0.08)+1)

    # Stitch the histograms together
    workspaces = ws1.name() + "," + ws2.name() + "," + ws3.name()
    stitched, scale = Stitch1DMany(InputWorkspaces=workspaces, StartOverlaps=[0.4, 1.2], EndOverlaps=[0.6, 1.4], Params=[0.02])

**Example - another example using three group workspaces of two workspaces each.**

    import numpy as np

      """Creates a gaussian peak centered on mu and with width sigma."""
      return (1/ sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) * np.exp( - (x-mu)**2  / (2*sigma**2))

    # Create six histograms with a single peak in each one
    x1 = np.arange(-1, 1, 0.02)
    x3 = np.arange(0.3, 1.8, 0.02)
    x5 = np.arange(1.4, 2.8, 0.02)
    x2 = np.arange(2.4, 3.5, 0.02)
    x4 = np.arange(3.2, 4.9, 0.02)
    x6 = np.arange(4.5, 5.2, 0.02)
    ws1 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x1, DataY=gaussian(x1[:-1], 0, 0.1)+1)
    ws3 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x3, DataY=gaussian(x3[:-1], 1, 0.05)+1)
    ws5 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x5, DataY=gaussian(x5[:-1], 2, 0.12)+1)
    ws2 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x2, DataY=gaussian(x2[:-1], 3, 0.08)+1)
    ws4 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x4, DataY=gaussian(x4[:-1], 4, 0.06)+1)
    ws6 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x6, DataY=gaussian(x6[:-1], 5, 0.04)+1)

    # Group first, second and third pairs of workspaces
    groupWSNames1 = ws1.name() + "," + ws2.name()
    gws1 = GroupWorkspaces(InputWorkspaces=groupWSNames1)
    groupWSNames2 = ws3.name() + "," + ws4.name()
    gws2 = GroupWorkspaces(InputWorkspaces=groupWSNames2)
    groupWSNames3 = ws5.name() + "," + ws6.name()
    gws3 = GroupWorkspaces(InputWorkspaces=groupWSNames3)

    # Stitch together workspaces from each group
    workspaceNames = gws1.name() + "," + gws2.name() + "," + gws3.name()
    stitched, scale = Stitch1DMany(InputWorkspaces=workspaceNames, StartOverlaps=[0.3, 1.4], EndOverlaps=[3.3, 4.6], Params=[0.02])
