Description
-----------

Stitches single histogram :ref:`Matrix Workspaces <MatrixWorkspace>`
together outputting a stitched Matrix Workspace. This algorithm is a
wrapper over :ref:`algm-Stitch1D`.

The workspaces must be histogrammed. Use :ref:`algm-ConvertToHistogram` on
workspaces prior to passing them to this algorithm.

The algorithm expects pairs of :literal:`StartOverlaps` and
:literal:`EndOverlaps` values. The order in which these are provided determines
the pairing. There should be N entries in each of these lists, where N = 1 - 
(No. of workspaces to stitch). StartOverlaps and EndOverlaps are in the same
units as the X-axis for the workspace and are optional. For each pair of these
values, the :literal:`StartOverlaps` value cannot exceed its corresponding
:literal:`EndOverlaps` value. Furthermore, if either the start or end value is
outside the range of X-axis intersection, they will be forcibly changed to the
intersection min and max respectively.

This algorithm is also capable of stitching together matrix workspaces
from multiple workspace groups. In this case, each group must contain the
same number of workspaces. The algorithm will stitch together the workspaces
in the first group before stitching workspaces from the next group on top
of the previous ones.

When stitching the workspaces, either the RHS or LHS workspaces can be scaled.
We can specify manual scale factors to use by setting
:literal:`UseManualScaleFactors` true and passing values to
:literal:`ManualScaleFactors`. For group workspaces, we can also use
:literal:`ScaleFactorFromPeriod` to select a period which will obtain a vector
of scale factors from the selected period. These scale factors are then applied
to all other periods when stitching.

Workflow
--------

The algorithm workflow is as follows:

#. A check is performed to find out whether the input workspaces are group
   workspaces or not. The algorithm handles matrix workspaces differently from
   group workspaces.
#. If matrix workspaces are supplied, the algorithm simply iterates over each
   workspace and calls the :literal:`Stitch1D` algorithm. This stitches each RHS
   workspace to the LHS workspace to form a single stitched workspace (LHS to
   RHS if ScaleRHSWorkspace is set to false). The resultant workspace and its
   scale factor are outputted.
#. If group workspaces are supplied, the algorithm checks whether or not to
   scale workspaces using scale factors from a specific period (given by
   :literal:`ScaleFactorFromPeriod`). This is done only if
   :literal:`UseManualScaleFactors` is true and :literal:`ManualScaleFactors` is
   set to its default value (empty).
#. If not using :literal:`ScaleFactorFromPeriod`, the algorithm collects the
   workspaces belonging to each period across all groups and calls
   :literal:`Stitch1DMany` for each period. As a selection of non-group
   workspaces are passed to it, this essential repeats step 2 for each period.
   Each of the resultant stitched workspaces stored in a vector while each list
   of out scale factors are appended to each other and outputted.
#. The vector of output stitched workspaces are passed to
   :literal:`GroupWorkspaces`, which groups the workspaces into a single
   workspace, which is then outputted.
#. If using :literal:`ScaleFactorFromPeriod`, the algorithm calls
   :literal:`Stitch1DMany` for a period specified by
   :literal:`ScaleFactorFromPeriod` and passes the same input workspaces. This
   returns a vector of period scale factors obtained by stitching workspaces
   from a specific period.
#. The algorithm iterates over each workspace for each period across all groups
   and calls :literal:`Stitch1D`, passing the scale factor from period scale
   factors for each period index. Like in step 4, the stitched workspaces are
   stored in a vector while the out scale factors are appended and outputted.
   Finally step 5 is performed, grouping the workspaces into a single one that
   is outputted.

In the diagram below, all input parameters other than
:literal:`InputWorkspaces`, :literal:`UseManualScaleFactors`,
:literal:`ManualScaleFactors` and :literal:`ScaleFactorFromPeriod` have been
omitted as they do not serve any purpose other than to be passed to the
:literal:`Stitch1DMany` algorithm.

Usage
-----
**Example - a basic example using Stitch1DMany to stitch three workspaces together.**

.. testcode:: ExStitch1DManySimple

    import numpy as np

    def gaussian(x, mu, sigma):
      """Creates a gaussian peak centered on mu and with width sigma."""
      return (1/ sigma * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) * np.exp( - (x-mu)**2  / (2*sigma**2))

    # Create three histograms with a single peak in each one
    x1 = np.arange(-1, 1, 0.02)
    x2 = np.arange(0.4, 1.6, 0.02)
    x3 = np.arange(1.3, 3, 0.02)
    ws1 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x1, DataY=gaussian(x1[:-1], 0, 0.1)+1)
    ws2 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x2, DataY=gaussian(x2[:-1], 1, 0.05)+1)
    ws3 = CreateWorkspace(UnitX="1/q", DataX=x3, DataY=gaussian(x3[:-1], 2, 0.08)+1)

    # Stitch the histograms together
    workspaces = ws1.name() + "," + ws2.name() + "," + ws3.name()
    stitched, scale = Stitch1DMany(InputWorkspaces=workspaces, StartOverlaps=[0.4, 1.2], EndOverlaps=[0.6, 1.4], Params=[0.02])
