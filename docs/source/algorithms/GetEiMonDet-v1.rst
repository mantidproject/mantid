Description
-----------

Get incident energy from one monitor and some detectors. If the minimum
distance from the sample to detectors is dmin, one will select detectors
in the range dmin to dmin\*MaximumDistanceFraction. These are grouped
together, appended to a copy of the monitor workspace, then fed to GetEi
algorithm. The output of this algorithm is identical to that of
:ref:`algm-GetEi`.

.. Note ::

    For some instruments (like CNCS and HYSPEC), :ref:`algm-GetEi` uses the incident 
    energy guess as the output instead of calculating one, so this algorithm does
    get a better estimate of Ei. The algorithm might soon be deprecated.
