Description
-----------

Extracts run parameters from the :ref:`RAW <Raw File>` file given as an
input property. If the ``GetRunParameters`` argument is ``True`` then a
:ref:`TableWorkspace <Table Workspaces>` is created that contains a
column for each value of the ``RPB_STRUCT``, i.e. column names such as ``r_dur``, ``r_goodfrm``
etc. If the ``GetSampleParameters`` argument is ``True`` then a
:ref:`TableWorkspace <Table Workspaces>` is created that contains a
column for each value of the ``SPB_STRUCT``, i.e. column names such as ``e_geom``, ``e_width``, etc.
This is Mantid's version of the ``Get`` routine in `Open Genie <http://www.opengenie.org/>`__.
