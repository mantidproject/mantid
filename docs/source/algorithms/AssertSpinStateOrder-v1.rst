Assert that the given Polarized SANS data (from either ZOOM or LARMOR) has the expected spin state order using DetermineSpinStateOrder. If the order of the data is found to be different from the given spin state order string, and ``Reorder`` is ``True``, then the child workspaces of the input group will be reordered to match the input string.
