Description
-----------

Creates a transmission run workspace given one or two TOF workspaces.
If two workspaces are provided, then the first workspace is considered
a low wavelength transmission run, and the second workspace is considered
a high wavelength transmission run.

Both input workspaces must have X-units of TOF. They are first converted
to units of wavelength and then stitched together using :ref:`algm-Stitch1D`.

A single output workspace is generated with X-units of Wavelength in angstroms.

In most cases you will want to use :ref:`algm-CreateTransmissionWorkspaceAuto`,
which is a facade over this algorithm that correctly configures the input
properties for you.

The diagram above illustrates the main steps in the algorithm. Below is a more
detailed diagram describing how transmission workspaces are converted to units
of wavelength and normalized by monitors.

**Example - Create a transmission run**

.. testcode:: ExCreateTransWSSimple

    trans = Load(Filename='INTER00013463.nxs')
    transWS = CreateTransmissionWorkspace(
      FirstTransmissionRun = trans,
      I0MonitorIndex = 2,
      ProcessingInstructions = '3,4',
      WavelengthMin = 1,
      WavelengthMax = 17,
      MonitorBackgroundWavelengthMin = 15,
      MonitorBackgroundWavelengthMax = 17,
      MonitorIntegrationWavelengthMin = 4,
      MonitorIntegrationWavelengthMax = 10,
      Version=1)

    print("The first four transWS Y values are:")
    for i in range (4):
        print("{:.4f}".format(transWS.readY(0)[i]))

Output:

.. testoutput:: ExCreateTransWSSimple

    The first four transWS Y values are:
    0.0255
    0.0758
    0.1322
    0.1422

**Example - Create a transmission run from two runs**

.. testcode:: ExCreateTransWSTwo

    trans1 = Load(Filename='INTER00013463.nxs')
    trans2 = Load(Filename='INTER00013464.nxs')
    transWS = CreateTransmissionWorkspace(
      FirstTransmissionRun = trans1,
      SecondTransmissionRun = trans2,
      Params = [1.5,0.02,17],
      StartOverlap = 10.0,
      EndOverlap = 12.0,
      I0MonitorIndex = 2,
      ProcessingInstructions = '3,4',
      WavelengthMin = 1,
      WavelengthMax = 17,
      MonitorBackgroundWavelengthMin = 15,
      MonitorBackgroundWavelengthMax = 17,
      MonitorIntegrationWavelengthMin = 4,
      MonitorIntegrationWavelengthMax = 10,
      Version=1)

    print("The first four transWS Y values are:")
    for i in range (4):
        print("{:.4f}".format(transWS.readY(0)[i]))

Output:

.. testoutput:: ExCreateTransWSTwo

    The first four transWS Y values are:
    0.0572
    0.0574
    0.0584
    0.0584
