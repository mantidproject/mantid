Description
-----------

This executes the exponential function on a :ref:`MDHistoWorkspace <MDHistoWorkspace>`.

The signal :math:`a` becomes :math:`f = e^a`

The error :math:`da` becomes :math:`df^2 = f^2 * da^2`

This algorithm cannot be run on a
`MDEventWorkspace <http://www.mantidproject.org/MDEventWorkspace>`__. Its equivalent on a
:ref:`MatrixWorkspace <MatrixWorkspace>` is called
:ref:`algm-Exponential`.
