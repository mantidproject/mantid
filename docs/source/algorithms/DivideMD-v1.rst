Description
-----------

Divide two :ref:`MDHistoWorkspace <MDHistoWorkspace>`'s or a
MDHistoWorkspace and a scalar.

The error of :math:`f = a / b` is propagated with
:math:`df^2 = f^2 * (da^2 / a^2 + db^2 / b^2)`

-  **MDHistoWorkspace / MDHistoWorkspace**

   -  The operation is performed element-by-element.

-  **MDHistoWorkspace / Scalar**

   -  Every element of the MDHistoWorkspace is divided by the scalar.

-  **Scalar / MDHistoWorkspace**

   -  This is not allowed.

-  :ref:`MDEventWorkspace <MDWorkspace>`'s

   -  This operation is not supported, as it is not clear what its
      meaning would be.
