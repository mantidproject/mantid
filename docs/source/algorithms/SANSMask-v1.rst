Description
-----------

Apply a mask to a SANS detector. This workflow algorithm will apply any mask that was saved
in the logs by the reduction UI. It can also apply a mask to the edge of the detectors
according to whether we are dealing with EQSANS or a HFIR SANS.

This algorithm is rarely called directly. It is called by
:ref:`SANSReduction <algm-SANSReduction>` or :ref:`HFIRSANSReduction <algm-HFIRSANSReduction>`.
