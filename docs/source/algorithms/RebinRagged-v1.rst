Description
-----------

This is a workflow algorithm that rebins each spectrum of a workspace independently.
This is intended for workspaces with a relatively small number of spectra (e.g. <10), but places no restrictions on the input workspace.

The minimum and maximum values that are specified are interpreted as follows:

* One value per spectrum. If there is only one value overall, it is used for all of the spectra.
* ``numpy.nan``, ``math.nan``, and ``np.inf`` are interpreted to mean use the data's minimum or maximum x-value.

The ``Delta`` parameter is required and can either be a single number which is common to all, or one number per spectra.
Positive values are interpreted as constant step-size. Negative are logorithmic.

Usage
-----

.. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

This is an example of how ``RebinRagged`` would be used near the end of a workflow to generate a real-space distribution of data after it had been reduced into a number of "banks" or "spectra."
As mentioned above, ``numpy.nan`` or ``math.nan`` can both be used.
This particular use-case, which uses the input workspace's binning, could be done with :ref:`CropWorkspaceRagged <algm-CropWorkspaceRagged>` with similar results.

.. code-block:: python

    from numpy import nan
    NOM_91796 = LoadNexusProcessed(Filename='NOM_91796_banks.nxs')
    RebinRagged(InputWorkspace=NOM_91796, OutputWorkspace='cropped',
                        Xmin=[0.67, 1.20, 2.42, 3.70, 4.12, 0.39],
                        Delta=0.02,
                        Xmax=[10.20, 20.8, nan, nan, nan, 9.35])
