Description
-----------

Loads a shape into the sample of a workspace. The newly added shape can be translated by a vector, and rotated by an angle along each axis applied in order X,Y,Z, rotation applies before translation eg if the shape in the input file isn't centred on the origin. The Sample will then be rotated according to the rotation of the goniometer on the workspace, if there is one. The first angle used in `SetGoniometer` will be applied last.

The following types of input file are supported:

* ``*.stl`` stereolithography `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)>`_
  This is a file format consisting of a list of faces specified by their vertex coordinates.
  The file may be in ASCII or Binary format, and all the faces must be triangular.
  The normals are ignored, but the vertices must be in the order required by the standard
  (counter-clockwise when viewed from outside).
* ``*.off`` Object File Format `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFF_(file_format) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OFF_(file_format)>`_
  This is a file format consisting of a list of vertices and a list of faces specified by the position of
  each vertex in the list of vertices.
  The file must is in ASCII for and all the faces must be triangular. There are no normals.
  The vertices of a face must be ordered counter-clockwise when viewed from outside.
