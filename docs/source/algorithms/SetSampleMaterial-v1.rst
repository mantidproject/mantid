Description
-----------

Sets the neutrons information in the sample. You can either enter details 
about the chemical formula or atomic number, or you can provide specific 
values for the attenuation and scattering cross sections and the sample number 
density. If you provide a chemical formula or atomic number, the cross 
sections will be calculated from a database. If you decide to provide specific 
cross sections, they will override the tabulated ones. For details of how the 
various quantities are calculated, refer to the :ref:`Materials` concept page.

.. note:: It is recommended that you use :ref:`SetSample <algm-SetSample>` instead.
