Description
-----------

Sets the neutrons information in the sample. You can either enter details
about the chemical formula or atomic number, or you can provide specific
values for the attenuation and scattering cross sections and the sample number
density. If you provide a chemical formula or atomic number, the cross
sections will be calculated from a database. If you decide to provide specific
cross sections, they will override the tabulated ones. For details of how the
various quantities are calculated, refer to the :ref:`Materials` concept page.

.. note:: It is recommended that you use :ref:`SetSample <algm-SetSample>` instead.
