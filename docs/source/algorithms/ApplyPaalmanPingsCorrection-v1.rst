Description
-----------

Applies absorption corrections calculated in the Paalman and Pings
absorption factor format. The various partial absorption factors are
denoted as :math:`A_{a,b}` where the subscript :math:`a` denotes the
component the neutron is scattered from and :math:`b` denotes the
component where the neutron is absorbed. The various partial
absorption factors, and what their names must contain in the
``CorrectionsWorkspace`` group are detailed in the table below. If any
of the partial absorption factors are not supplied, they are assumed
to be one.

================ ============ ==================== ==============
    Symbol       Scatter From Absorbed By          Workspace Name

:math:`A_{s,s}`  sample       sample               ``ass``

:math:`A_{s,sc}` sample       sample and container ``assc``

:math:`A_{c,c}`  container    container            ``acc``
---------------- ------------ -------------------- --------------
:math:`A_{c,sc}` container    sample and container ``acsc``
================ ============ ==================== ==============

This algorithm can be used to apply absorption corrections calculated
with either the :ref:`CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrection
<algm-CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrection>` and
:ref:`FlatPlatePaalmanPingsCorrection
<algm-FlatPlatePaalmanPingsCorrection>` algorithms as well as the
legacy indirect calculate corrections routine, providing that the
sample and container are first converted to wavelength and the
corrections are interpolated to match the sample as demonstrated in
the example below.

All workspaces are converted into wavelength using the appropriate
mode of :ref:`ConvertUnits <algm-ConvertUnits>`. Then
``CanShiftFactor`` is added to wavelength of the ``CanWorkspace``.
Then one of the two following equations is performed
(dependent on the number of correction factors provided):

.. math:: I_s = \frac{1}{A_{s,sc}} \left( I_{sc}^E - I_c^E K_c \frac{A_{c,sc}}{A_{c,c}} \right)
.. math:: I_s = \frac{1}{A_{s,s}} \left( I_{sc}^E \right) - \frac{1}{A_{c,c}} \left( I_{c}^E \right)

The variables that are not defined above are

Variable         Parameter Name           Default
================ ======================== =======
:math:`I_s`      ``OutputWorkspace``      N/A

The workflow diagrams below are another representation of the equation
above with the simplifications for when the various terms are missing
or one.

Workflow
--------

Depending on the input workspaces and correction factors provided to the algorithm
it may operate in one of four ways, each of which is described on a separate
workflow diagram.

Container Scale Only
====================

In the case where only a container workspace and no correction factors are
provided.

.. diagram:: ApplyPaalmanPingsCorrection-v1_canscaleonly_wkflw.dot

Sample Corrections Only
=======================

In the case where only correction factors and no container workspace is
provided.

.. diagram:: ApplyPaalmanPingsCorrection-v1_samplecorrectiononly_wkflw.dot

Two-Factor Approximation
========================

In the case where a container workspace, along with the :math:`A_{s,s}`
and :math:`A_{c, c}` factors are provided.

.. diagram:: ApplyPaalmanPingsCorrection-v1_twofactorcorrection_wkflw.dot

Full Corrections
================

In the case where a container workspace, along with the :math:`A_{s,sc}`,
:math:`A_{c,c}` and :math:`A_{c,sc}` factors are provided.

Usage
-----

**Example: using with legacy indirect corrections data**

.. testcode:: exSampleAndCanIRISLegacyCorrections

    # Load the sample and can
    sample_ws = Load('irs26176_graphite002_red.nxs')
    can_ws = Load('irs26173_graphite002_red.nxs')

    # Convert sample and container workspaces to wavelength
    sample_ws = ConvertUnits(InputWorkspace=sample_ws,
                             Target='Wavelength',
                             EMode='Indirect',
                             EFixed=1.845)
    can_ws = ConvertUnits(InputWorkspace=can_ws,
                          Target='Wavelength',
                          EMode='Indirect',
                          EFixed=1.845)

    # Load the corrections workspace
    corrections_ws = Load('irs26176_graphite002_cyl_Abs.nxs')

    # Interpolate each of the correction factor workspaces to match the
    # binning of the sample
    # Required to use corrections from the old indirect calculate
    # corrections routines
    for factor_ws in corrections_ws:
        SplineInterpolation(WorkspaceToMatch=sample_ws,
                            WorkspaceToInterpolate=factor_ws,
                            OutputWorkspace=factor_ws,
                            OutputWorkspaceDeriv='')

    corr = ApplyPaalmanPingsCorrection(SampleWorkspace=sample_ws,
                                       CorrectionsWorkspace=corrections_ws,
                                       CanWorkspace=can_ws)

    print('Corrected workspace has {} spectra over {} bins'.format(corr.getNumberHistograms(), corr.blocksize()))

    print('Type of correction applied: {}'.format(corr.getRun()['corrections_type'].value))

Output:

.. testoutput:: exSampleAndCanIRISLegacyCorrections

    Corrected workspace has 10 spectra over 1905 bins
    Type of correction applied: sample_and_can_corrections
