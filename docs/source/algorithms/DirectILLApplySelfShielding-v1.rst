Description
-----------

This algorithm subtracts empty container data and applies self-shielding corrections to *InputWorkspace*. Both operations are optional: what is actually done depends on the input properties.

This algorithm is part of :ref:`ILL's direct geometry data reduction algorithms <DirectILL>`.

*SelfShieldingCorrectionWorkspace* can be obtained from the :ref:`DirectILLSelfShielding <algm-DirectILLSelfShielding>` algorithm.

Usage
-----

For usage of this algorithm, check the examples :ref:`here <DirectILL>`.
