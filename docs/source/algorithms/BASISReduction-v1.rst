For each property, the algorithm will remember the last value used. If user deletes
this value and leaves blank the property field, the default value will be used. Default
values are typical of the silicon111 reflection.

Description
-----------

**Run numbers**:
The syntax for the run numbers designation allows runs to be segregated
into sets. The semicolon symbol ";" is used to separate the runs into sets.
Runs within each set are jointly reduced.

Examples:

- 2144-2147,2149,2156  is a single set. All runs jointly reduced.

- 2144-2147,2149;2156  is set 2144-2147,2149 and set 2156. The sets are reduced separately from each other.

If *DoIndividual* is checked, then each run number is reduced separately
from the rest. The semicolon symbol is ignored.

**Momentum transfer binning scheme**: Three values are required, the
center of the bin with the minimum momentum, the bin width, and the
center of the bin with the maximum momentum.

**Rescaling to first spectrum**: Since the Y-scale has arbitrary units, a
rescaling convention is taken whereby the maximum of the
first spectrum (lowest Q-value) is rescaled to 1.0. This rescaling may not
be employed when the intent is to compare to other runs, like can substraction
of comparison between deuterated and hydrogenated samples.

Reflection Selector
===================

Currently two types of reflection are possible, associated with the two analyzers of BASIS.
There are typical values for the properties of each reflection:

+------------+----------------+------------------------+
| Reflection |  Energy bins   | Momentum transfer bins |
|            |   (micro-eV)   |   (inverse Angstroms)  |
+============+================+========================+
| silicon111 | -150, 0.4, 500 |      0.3, 0.2, 1.9     |
+------------+----------------+------------------------+
| silicon311 | -740, 1.6, 740 |      0.5, 0.2, 3.7     |
+------------+----------------+------------------------+

Also the following default mask files are associated to each reflection:

+-----------+----------------------------+
|Reflection | Mask file                  |
+===========+============================+
|silicon111 | BASIS_Mask_default_111.xml |
+-----------+----------------------------+
|silicon311 | BASIS_Mask_default_311.xml |
+-----------+----------------------------+

These mask files can be found in the SNS filesystem
(**/SNS/BSS/shared/autoreduce/new_masks_08_12_2015/**)


Vanadium Normalization
======================

The syntax for the vanadium run numbers designation (**NormRunNumbers**) is the same as in
the case of the sample (hyphens and commas are understood) but no
semicolons are allowed. As a result, only one set of vanadium run numbers
is generated, and all runs are jointly reduced into a single vanadium workspace.
Thus, if we had entered three sets of sample run numbers, then three
reduced workspaces will be produced and all will be divided by the same
vanadium workspace.

Normalization type **by Q slice** is the default
normalization. In this case, the sample is reduced into :math:`S_{s}(Q,E)` and
the vanadium is reduced into :math:`S_{v}(Q,E)`. Later, :math:`S_{v}(Q,E)` is integrated
along the energy axis in the range [-0.034, 0.034]meV to produce :math:`S_{v}(Q)`.
Finally the sample is divided by the vanadium, :math:`S_{s}(Q,E) / S_{v}(Q)`.

Normalization type **by detector ID** carries out the division on each
detector of the instrument. If we have for detector :math:`i` sample :math:`S_s(\lambda, i)`
and vanadium :math:`S_v(\lambda, i)`, we integrate along the :math:`\lambda` axis in the
range given by **NormWavelengthRange** to obtain
:math:`S_v(i)` and then divide :math:`S_s(\lambda, i)/S_v(i)=S'_s(\lambda, i)`. From this
point on, the reduction process continues using :math:`S'_s` in place of :math:`S_s`.

Usage
-----

**Perform a reduction:**

.. code-block:: python

    BASISReduction(RunNumbers="59671",
                   EnergyBins=[-120,0.4,120],
                   MomentumTransferBins=[0.3, 0.2, 1.9],
                   DivideByVanadium=1,
                   NormRunNumbers="58183")
