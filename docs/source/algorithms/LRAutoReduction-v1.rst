Description
-----------

This algorithm gathers the information needed to launch the LR reduction. It is called by the
post-processing system after a new data file is created.

If a reduction template file is provided, the reduction will use the options in that file.
If no reduction template is provided, reduction parameters will be read from the Nexus file.

For sample data runs, the :ref:`LiquidsReflectometryReduction <algm-LiquidsReflectometryReduction>`
algorithm is called to perform the reduction, followed by the
:ref:`LRReflectivityOutput <algm-LRReflectivityOutput>` algorithm to put the different pieces of
the reduced data into a single reflectivity file.

For direct beams, the :ref:`LRDirectBeamSort <algm-LRDirectBeamSort>` workflow algorithm is
called to generate a scaling factor file.
