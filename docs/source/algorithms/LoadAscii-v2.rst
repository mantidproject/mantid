Description
-----------

The LoadAscii2 algorithm reads in spectra data from a text file and
stores it in a `Workspace2D <http://www.mantidproject.org/Workspace2D>`_ as data points. The data in
the file must be organized in columns separated by commas, tabs, spaces,
colons or semicolons. Only one separator type can be used throughout the
file; use the "Separator" property to tell the algorithm which to use.
The algorithm :ref:`SaveAscii2 <algm-SaveAscii-v2>` is normally able to produce
such a file.

The format must be:

-  A single integer or blank line to denote a new spectra
-  For each bin, between two and four columns of delimited data in the
   following order: 1st column=X, 2nd column=Y, 3rd column=E, 4th
   column=DX (X error)
-  Comments can be included by prefixing the line with a non-numerical
   character which must be consistent throughout the file and specified
   when you load the file. Defaults to "#"
-  The number of bins is defined by the number of rows and must be
   identical for each spectra

The following is an example valid file of 4 spectra of 2 bins each with
no X error::

    #. X , Y , E

    1 2.00000000,2.00000000,1.00000000 4.00000000,1.00000000,1.00000000 2
    2.00000000,5.00000000,2.00000000 4.00000000,4.00000000,2.00000000 3
    2.00000000,3.00000000,1.00000000 4.00000000,0.00000000,0.00000000 4
    2.00000000,0.00000000,0.00000000 4.00000000,0.00000000,0.00000000


Usage
-----

**Example**

.. testcode:: LoadASCII

    #import the os path libraries for directory functions
    import os

    # create histogram workspace
    dataX1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] # or use dataX1=range(0,10)
    dataY1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] # or use dataY1=range(0,9)
    dataE1 = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1] # or use dataE1=[1]*9

    ws1 = CreateWorkspace(dataX1, dataY1, dataE1)

    #Create an absolute path by joining the proposed filename to a directory
    #os.path.expanduser("~") used in this case returns the home directory of the current user
    savefile = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"), "AsciiFile.txt")

    # perform the algorithm
    SaveAscii(InputWorkspace=ws1,Filename=savefile)

    #Load it again - Load would work just as well as LoadAscii
    wsOutput = LoadAscii(savefile,Unit="Label")

    print(CompareWorkspaces(ws1,wsOutput)[0])

    #clean up the file I saved
    os.remove(savefile)

Output:

.. testoutput:: LoadASCII
