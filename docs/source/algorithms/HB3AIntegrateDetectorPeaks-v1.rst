Description
-----------

The input to this algorithm is intended as part of the DEMAND data
reduction workflow, using :ref:`HB3AAdjustSampleNorm
<algm-HB3AAdjustSampleNorm>` with `OutputType=Detector` which can be
seen below in the example usage.

This will reduce the input workspace using the region of interest
provided to create a 1-dimension workspace with an axis that is the
detector scan, either omega or chi in degrees.

An optional fitting range of the scan axis can be provided with
`StartX` and `EndX` in degrees, which is applicable for the
`CountsWithFitting` and `Fitted` methods.

The `OptimizeQVector` option will convert the input data into Q and
use :ref:`CentroidPeaksdMD <algm-CentroidPeaksMD>` to find the
correct Q-vector starting from the known HKL and UB matrix of the
peaks. This will not effect the integration of the peak but allows the
UB matrix to be refined afterwards.

Integration Methods
###################

There are three different methods for integrating the input workspace:
simple counts summation, simple counts summation with fitted background,
and a fitted model.

Counts
++++++

This method uses the simple cuboid integration to approximate the
integrated peak intensity.

.. math:: I = \sum_i (C_i - B_i) \times \Delta X

where
  * :math:`C_i` is the normalized detector counts in ROI of measurement *i*
  * :math:`\Delta X` is the motor step
  * :math:`B_i` is the estimated background

The error is calculated as

.. math:: \sigma = \sum_i \sqrt{C_i} \cdot \Delta X

The background is estimated by averaging data from the first and last scans:

.. math:: B = \frac{\sum_i^{<pt>}C_i}{|<pt>|}

where :math:`<pt>` is the number of scans to include in the background estimation
and is specified with the `NumBackgroundPts` option.

CountsWithFitting
+++++++++++++++++

For `Method=CountsWithFitting`, the input is fit to a :ref:`Gaussian
<func-Gaussian>` with a :ref:`flat background <func-FlatBackground>`,
just like `Method=Fitting`. However, the peak intensity is instead
approximated by summing the detector counts over a specific set of
measurements that are defined by the motor positions in the range of
:math:`\pm \frac{N}{2} \text{FWHM}`, where `N` is controlled with the
`WidthScale` option. The background is removed over the same
range using the fitted flat background.

.. math:: I = \sum_i^{<pt>} (C_i - B) \times \Delta X

where
  *  :math:`C_i` is the normalized detector counts in ROI of measurement *i*
  *  :math:`\Delta X` is the motor step
  *  :math:`B_i` is the estimated background
  *  the set of measurements *<pt>* is defined by the motor positions in the range of :math:`x_0 \pm \frac{N}{2}FWHM`.

     -  usually the default value of *N* is set to 2.
     -  :math:`FWHM = 2\sqrt{2\ln2}s \approx 2.3548s`

The error is calculated as

.. math:: \sigma = \sum_i \sqrt{C_i} \cdot \Delta X

Fitted
++++++

For `Method=Fitted`, the reduced workspace is fitted using
:ref:`Fit <algm-Fit>` with a :ref:`flat background <func-FlatBackground>`
and a :ref:`Gaussian <func-Gaussian>`, then the area of the Gaussian is
used as the peak intensity:

.. math:: I = A\times s\times\sqrt{2\pi}

The error of the intensity is calculated by the propagation of fitted error of *A* and *s*.

.. math:: \sigma_I^2 = 2\pi (A^2\cdot \sigma_s^2 + \sigma_A^2\cdot s^2 + 2\cdot A\cdot s\cdot \sigma_{As})

Usage
-----

**Example - DEMAND single detector peak integration**

.. testcode::

   data = HB3AAdjustSampleNorm(Filename='HB3A_data.nxs', OutputType='Detector')
   peaks = HB3AIntegrateDetectorPeaks(data,
                                      ChiSqMax=100,
                                      OutputFitResults=True,
                                      LowerLeft=[200, 200],
                                      UpperRight=[312, 312])
   print('HKL={h:.0f}{k:.0f}{l:.0f} λ={Wavelength}Å Intensity={Intens:.3f}'.format(**peaks.row(0)))

.. testoutput::

   HKL=006 λ=1.008Å Intensity=211.753

To check the ROI and peak fitting you can plot the results

.. code-block:: python

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9.6, 4.8))
   ax1 = fig.add_subplot(121, projection='mantid')
   ax2 = fig.add_subplot(122, projection='mantid')
   ax1.pcolormesh(mtd['peaks_data_ROI'], transpose=True)
   ax1.set_title("ROI")
   ax2.plot(mtd['peaks_data_Workspace'], wkspIndex=0, label='data')
   ax2.plot(mtd['peaks_data_Workspace'], wkspIndex=1, label='calc')
   ax2.plot(mtd['peaks_data_Workspace'], wkspIndex=2, label='diff')
   ax2.legend()
   ax2.set_title("Fitted integrated peak")
   fig.tight_layout()
   fig.show()

**Example - DEMAND multiple files, indexing with modulation vector**

.. code-block:: python

   IPTS = 24855
   exp = 755
   scans = range(28, 96)
   filename = '/HFIR/HB3A/IPTS-{}/shared/autoreduce/HB3A_exp{:04}_scan{:04}.nxs'

   data = HB3AAdjustSampleNorm(','.join(filename.format(IPTS, exp, scan) for scan in scans), OutputType="Detector")
   peaks = HB3AIntegrateDetectorPeaks(data)
   IndexPeaks(peaks, ModVector1='0,0,0.5', MaxOrder=1, SaveModulationInfo=True)
   SaveReflections(peaks, Filename='peaks.hkl')
