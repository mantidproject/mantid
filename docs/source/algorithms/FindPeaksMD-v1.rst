Description
-----------

This algorithm is used to find single-crystal peaks in a
multi-dimensional workspace (`MDEventWorkspace <http://www.mantidproject.org/MDEventWorkspace>`_ or
:ref:`MDHistoWorkspace <MDHistoWorkspace>`). It looks for high signal
density areas, and is based on an algorithm designed by Dennis Mikkelson
for ISAW.

The algorithm proceeds in this way:

-  Sorts all the boxes in the workspace by decreasing order of signal
   density (total weighted event sum divided by box volume).

   -  It will skip any boxes with a density below a threshold. The
      threshold is
      :math:`TotalSignal / TotalVolume * DensityThresholdFactor`.

-  The centroid of the strongest box is considered a peak.
-  The centroid of the next strongest box is calculated.

   -  We look through all the peaks that have already been found. If the
      box is too close to an existing peak, it is rejected. This
      distance is PeakDistanceThreshold.

-  This is repeated until we find up to MaxPeaks peaks.

Each peak created is placed in the output
:ref:`PeaksWorkspace <PeaksWorkspace>`, which can be a new workspace or
replace the old one.

This algorithm works on a :ref:`MDHistoWorkspace <MDHistoWorkspace>`
resulting from the :ref:`algm-BinMD` algorithm also. It works in the
same way, except that the center of each bin is used since the centroid
is not accessible. It may give better results on
:ref:`Workspace2D <Workspace2D>`'s that were converted to
:ref:`MDWorkspaces <MDWorkspace>`.


For data which has originally been based on histogram-type data and that has been converted to 
event-based data it might be beneficial to select the NumberOfEventNormalization for the `PeakFindingStrategy` property instead of the VolumeNormalization which is the default. This
will disable the `DensityThresholdFactor` property and enable the `SignalThresholdFactor` property.
The algorithmic steps remain the same as above but instead of using the signal density as the sorting
quantity the signal count (total weighted event sum divided by the number of events) is used. If 
the events are weighted this will result in boxes with signal counts larger than one for peaks and for the majority of background counts the signal count will be 1. Hence it is possible to discriminate between peaks and background. Note that the NumberOfEventNormalization selection of the `PeakFindingStrategy` property  does not make sense for all scenarios and infact might not produce useful results for your particular case.


Calculate Goniometer For Constant Wavelength
############################################

The CalculateGoniometerForCW option allows you to keep only one
instrument definition from a set of merged MD workspaces. It only
works for a constant wavelength source and only for Q sample
workspaces. It also assumes the goniometer rotation is around the
y-axis only.

The goniometer (:math:`G`) is calculated from
:math:`\textbf{Q}_{sample}` for a given wavelength (:math:`\lambda`)
by:

First calculate the :math:`\textbf{Q}_{lab}` using
:math:`\textbf{Q}_{sample}` and :math:`\lambda`.

.. math:: k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}

.. math:: G \textbf{Q}_{sample} = \textbf{Q}_{lab} = \left(\begin{array}{c}
          -k\sin(\theta)\cos(\phi) \\
          -k\sin(\theta)\sin(\phi) \\
          k (1-\cos(\theta))
          \end{array}\right) (1)

.. math:: |\textbf{Q}_{sample}|^2 = |\textbf{Q}_{lab}|^2 = 2 k^2 (1-\cos(\theta))

:math:`\therefore`

.. math:: \theta = \cos^{-1}(1-\frac{|\textbf{Q}_{sample}|^2}{2k^2})

.. math:: \phi = \sin^{-1}(-\textbf{Q}_{sample}^y \sin(\theta)/k)

where :math:`\theta` is from 0 to :math:`\pi` and  :math:`\phi` is from :math:`-\pi/2` to :math:`\pi/2`. This means that it will assume your detector position is on the left of the beam even it it's not.

Now you have :math:`\theta`, :math:`\phi` and k you can get :math:`\textbf{Q}_{lab}` using (1).

We need to now solve :math:`G \textbf{Q}_{sample} =
\textbf{Q}_{lab}`. For a rotation around y-axis only we want to find
:math:`\psi` for:

.. math:: G = \begin{bmatrix}
	  \cos(\psi)  & 0 & \sin(\psi) \\
	  0           & 1 & 0 \\
	  -\sin(\psi) & 0 & \cos(\psi)
	  \end{bmatrix} (2)

which gives two equations

.. math:: \cos(\psi)\textbf{Q}_{sample}^x+\sin(\psi)\textbf{Q}_{sample}^z = \textbf{Q}_{lab}^x
.. math:: -\sin(\psi)\textbf{Q}_{sample}^x+\cos(\psi)\textbf{Q}_{sample}^z = \textbf{Q}_{lab}^z

make

.. math:: A = \begin{bmatrix}
          \textbf{Q}_{sample}^x & \textbf{Q}_{sample}^z \\
          \textbf{Q}_{sample}^z & \textbf{Q}_{sample}^x
          \end{bmatrix}

.. math:: B = \begin{bmatrix}
	  \textbf{Q}_{lab}^x \\
	  \textbf{Q}_{lab}^z
	  \end{bmatrix}

Then we need to solve :math:`A X = B` for :math:`X` where

.. math:: X = \begin{bmatrix}
              \cos{\psi} \\
              \sin{\psi}
              \end{bmatrix} = A^{-1} B

then

.. math:: \psi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sin{\psi}}{\cos{\psi}}\right)

Put :math:`\psi` into (2) and you have the goniometer for that peak.

Usage
------

**Example - IntegratePeaks:**

The code iteslef works but disabled from doc tests as takes too long to complete. User should provide its own
event nexus file instead of **TOPAZ_3132_event.nxs** used within this example. The original **TOPAZ_3132_event.nxs**
file is available in `Mantid system tests repository <https://github.com/mantidproject/systemtests/tree/master/Data/TOPAZ_3132_event.nxs>`_.
