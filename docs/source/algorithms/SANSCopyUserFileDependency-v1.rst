Description
-----------

Extracts the dependencies from a SANS user file, locates them and copies them to a target directory. The user file and its dependencies need to be known to the Mantid user directories. The output directory needs to exist and will not be created automatically. Note that items in the target directory which have the same name as a dependency will be overwritten.
