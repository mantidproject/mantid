Description
-----------

Perform USANS reduction.

- Load the data and the empty run.
- Normalize the data.
- Compute the transmission and apply the transmission correction.

The procedure is repeated for each monochromator reflection.
Each analyzer angle is treated separately.

**Note: This algorithm is under active development.**

More details about the procedure will be documented here as the complete reduction process becomes available.
