Description
-----------

Statistics of the Peaks Workspaces are calculated for all peaks and by
default for resolution shell(d-Spacing).  There is a SortBy option to change this
to by orientation (RunNumber) or by Anger camera (bank) or only do all peaks.
This algorithm calls :ref:`algm-SortHKL`, so more details are in the documentation for that algorithm.

After removing invalid peaks with :math:`I \leq 0`, :math:`\sigma \leq 0` and :math:`h=k=l=0`,
the peaks are assigned to their respective unique reflection so that each theoretically present
reflection may have :math:`n` observations (:math:`n` can be zero). The number of unique reflections
which have at least one observation can be labeled :math:`N_{unique}`.

The intensities of peaks in each reflection are checked for outliers, which are removed. Outliers
in this context are peaks with an intensity that deviates more than :math:`3\sigma_{hkl}` from the
mean of the reflection, where :math:`\sigma_{hkl}` is the standard deviation of the peak intensities.

Formulas for the statistics columns are:

        :math:`N_{unique}`

        :math:`dSpacing_{min}`

        :math:`dSpacing_{max}`

        :math:`Multiplicity =  \frac{N_{observed}}{N_{unique}}`

        :math:`\langle \frac{I}{\sigma_I} \rangle`

        In the following, all sums over hkl extend only over unique reflections with more than one observation! Output is percentages.

        :math:`R_{merge} = 100 * \frac{\sum_{hkl} \sum_{j} \vert I_{hkl,j}-\langle I_{hkl}\rangle\vert}{\sum_{hkl} \sum_{j}I_{hkl,j}}`
        where :math:`\langle I_{hkl}\rangle` is the average of j multiple measurements of the n equivalent reflections.


        :math:`R_{pim} = 100 * \frac{\sum_{hkl} \sqrt \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \vert I_{hkl,j}-\langle I_{hkl}\rangle\vert}{\sum_{hkl} \sum_{j}I_{hkl,j}}`

        :math:`Completeness =  100 * \frac{N_{unique}}{N_{theoretical}}`


Usage
-----

**Example - an example of running StatisticsOfPeaksWorkspace with PointGroup option.**

.. testcode:: ExStatisticsOfPeaksWorkspaceOption

    # Load example peak data and find cell
    peaks = LoadIsawPeaks(Filename=r'Peaks5637.integrate')

    FindUBUsingFFT(peaks, MinD=0.25, MaxD=10, Tolerance=0.2)
    SelectCellWithForm(peaks, FormNumber=9, Apply=True, Tolerance=0.15)
    OptimizeLatticeForCellType(peaks,
                               CellType='Hexagonal', Apply=True, Tolerance=0.2)

    # Run the SortHKL algorithm
    sorted, statistics_table = StatisticsOfPeaksWorkspace(peaks, PointGroup='-3m1 (Trigonal - Hexagonal)',
                                                          LatticeCentering='Rhombohedrally centred, obverse',
                                                          SortBy='Overall')

    statistics = statistics_table.row(0)

    peak = sorted.getPeak(0)
    print("HKL of first peak in table {} {} {}".format(peak.getH(),peak.getK(),peak.getL()))
    print("Multiplicity = %.2f" % statistics['Multiplicity'])
    print("Resolution Min = %.2f" % statistics['Resolution Min'])
    print("Resolution Max = %.2f" % statistics['Resolution Max'])
    print("No. of Unique Reflections = %i" % statistics['No. of Unique Reflections'])
    print("Mean ((I)/sd(I)) = %.2f" % statistics['Mean ((I)/sd(I))'])
    print("Rmerge = %.2f" % statistics['Rmerge'])
    print("Rpim = %.2f" % statistics['Rpim'])

Output:

.. testoutput:: ExStatisticsOfPeaksWorkspaceOption

    HKL of first peak in table -10.0 5.0 42.0
    Multiplicity = 1.21
    Resolution Min = 0.21
    Resolution Max = 2.08
    No. of Unique Reflections = 337
    Mean ((I)/sd(I)) = 27.51
    Rmerge = 10.08
    Rpim = 10.08
