Description
-----------

This is a variation of the stretched exponential option of
:ref:`Quasi <algm-BayesQuasi2>`. For each spectrum a fit is performed
for a grid of :math:`\beta` a FWHM values. The unnormalised probability
is given for the :math:`z` values.

This routine replaces the :ref:`BayesStretch <algm-BayesStretch>` algorithm.
