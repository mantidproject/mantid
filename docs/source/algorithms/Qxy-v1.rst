Description
-----------

This algorithm rebins a 2D workspace in units of wavelength into 2D Q.
The reduction it performs is the same as that executed by the
:ref:`algm-Q1D` algorithm, expect performed in 2D instead of 1D. Hence,
for further documentation on how this algorithm works please see
:ref:`algm-Q1D`.
