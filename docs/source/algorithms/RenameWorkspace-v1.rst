Description
-----------

Renames a workspace to a different name in the data service. If the same
name is provided for input and output then the algorithm will fail with
an error. The Renaming is implemented as a removal of the original
workspace from the data service and re-addition under the new name.

If run on a group workspace, the members of the group will be renamed if
their names follow the pattern groupName\_1, groupName\_2, etc. (they
will be renamed to newName\_1, newname\_2, etc.). Otherwise, only the
group itself will be renamed - the members will keep their previous
names.



Usage
-----

**Example**

.. testcode:: ExRenameWorkspace

   myWs=CreateSampleWorkspace()

   print "myWs name:", myWs.name()
   print "myWs exists in Mantid?", mtd.doesExist(myWs.name())

   newNameWs = RenameWorkspace(myWs)

   print "newNameWs name:", newNameWs.name()
   print "newNameWs exists in Mantid?", mtd.doesExist(newNameWs.name())

   print "As myWs is just a refence to the workspace it now refers to the workspace with the new name"
   print "myWs name:", myWs.name()
   print "Does 'myWs' exist in Mantid?", mtd.doesExist("myWs")


Output:

.. testoutput:: ExRenameWorkspace

    myWs name: myWs
    myWs exists in Mantid? True
    newNameWs name: newNameWs
    newNameWs exists in Mantid? True
    As myWs is just a refence to the workspace it now refers to the workspace with the new name
    myWs name: newNameWs
    Does 'myWs' exist in Mantid? False
