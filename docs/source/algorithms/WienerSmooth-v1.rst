Description
-----------

This algorithm smooths the data in a workspace using the Wiener filter method.
The fiter is a function which if convolved with an input minimizes the noise in the output.

.. math:: s_o(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty s_i(\tau) w(t-\tau) d\tau

For more detail see Wikipedia article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_filter.

WienerSmooth uses the power spectrum of the input signal :math:`s_i` to build the filter
:math:`W(\nu)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty w(t)e^{-2\pi it\nu} dt`

First the noise level is estimated from the higher frequencies of the power spectrum.
Then the fiter function is constructed out of three pieces. The first piece is at the
lower frequencies where the power spectrum is well above the noise. At this region the
the filter function is calculated with the formula:

.. math:: W(\nu) = \frac{1}{1+N/P(\nu)},

where :math:`P(\nu)` is the power spectrum and :math:`N` is the noise. The higher the
power spectrum the closer the filter function to 1.

At the medium frequency range where the power spectrum is getting closer to the noise
the filter is described with a piece of a sigmoid decreasing to about the noise level.
After that all values are set to zero.

In this example the black curve is the input data and the red one is the result of smoothing.

Usage
-----

**Example - Smooth noisy data**

.. testcode::

    import random
    import math

    # Define a function
    def fun(x):
        return math.sin(x) + x /10

    # Create a workspace with noisy data.

    # Size of the data set
    n = 200

    # Define the x-values
    interval = (-10.0,10.0)
    dx = (interval[1] - interval[0]) / (n - 1)
    x = [interval[0] + dx * i for i in range(n)]

    # Define the y-values as a function fun(x) + random noise
    noise = 0.1
    y = [fun(x[i]) +  random.normalvariate(0.0,noise) for i in range(n)]

    # Create a workspace
    ws = CreateWorkspace(x,y)

    # Smooth the data using the Wiener filter
    smooth = WienerSmooth(ws,0)
