Description
-----------

The ``StartLiveData`` algorithm launches a background job that monitors and
processes live data.

The background algorithm started is :ref:`algm-MonitorLiveData`, which
simply calls :ref:`algm-LoadLiveData` at a fixed interval.

.. note::

   For details on the way to specify the data processing steps, see
   :ref:`LoadLiveData <algm-LoadLiveData>`.

Instructions for setting up a "fake" data stream are found `here
<http://www.mantidproject.org/MBC_Live_Data_Simple_Examples>`__.

Listener Properties
###################

Specific LiveListeners may provide their own properties, in addition to
properties provided by StartLiveData. For convenience and accessibility, these
properties are made available through StartLiveData as well.

In the StartLiveData algorithm dialog, a group box called "Listener Properties"
will appear at the bottom of the sidebar on the left, if the currently selected
listener provides additional properties.

In the Python API, these listener properties may also be set as keyword
arguments when calling StartLiveData. For example, in this code snippet:

.. code-block:: python

    StartLiveData(Instrument='ISIS_Histogram', OutputWorkspace='wsOut', UpdateEvery=1,
                  AccumulationMethod='Replace', PeriodList=[1,3], SpectraList=[2,4,6])

PeriodList and SpectraList are properties of the ISISHistoDataListener. They
are available as arguments in this call because Instrument is set to
'ISIS_Histogram', which uses that listener.

Live Plots
##########

Once live data monitoring has started, you can open a plot in
MantidPlot. For example, you can right-click a workspace and choose
"Plot Spectra".

As the data is acquired, this plot updates automatically.

Another way to start plots is to use `python MantidPlot
commands <MantidPlot:_Help#Python_Scripting_in_MantidPlot>`__. The
StartLiveData algorithm returns after the first chunk of data has been
loaded and processed. This makes it simple to write a script that will
open a live plot. For example:

.. code-block:: python

    StartLiveData(UpdateEvery='1.0',Instrument='FakeEventDataListener',
      ProcessingAlgorithm='Rebin',ProcessingProperties='Params=10e3,1000,60e3;PreserveEvents=1',
      OutputWorkspace='live')
    plotSpectrum('live', [0,1])

Run Transition Behavior
#######################

-  When the experimenter starts and stops a run, the Live Data Listener
   receives this as a signal.
-  The ``RunTransitionBehavior`` property specifies what to do at these
   run transitions.

   -  ``Restart``: the accumulated data (from the previous run if a run has
      just ended or from the time between runs a if a run has just
      started) is discarded as soon as the next chunk of data arrives.
   -  ``Stop``: live data monitoring ends. It will have to be restarted
      manually.
   -  ``Rename``: the previous workspaces are renamed, and monitoring
      continues with cleared ones. The run number, if found, is used to
      rename the old workspaces.

      -  There is a check for available memory before renaming; if there
         is not enough memory, the old data is discarded.

-  Note that LiveData continues monitoring even if outside of a run
   (i.e. before a run begins you will still receive live data).

Multiple Live Data Sessions
###########################

It is possible to have multiple live data sessions running at the same
time. Simply call ``StartLiveData`` more than once, but make sure to specify
unique names for the ``OutputWorkspace``.

Please note that you may be limited in how much simultaneous processing
you can do by your available memory and CPUs.

Usage
-----

**Example 1:**

.. testcode:: exStartLiveDataEvent

    from threading import Thread
    import time

    def startFakeDAE():
        # This will generate 2000 events roughly every 20ms, so about 50,000 events/sec
        # They will be randomly shared across the 100 spectra
        # and have a time of flight between 10,000 and 20,000
        try:
            FakeISISEventDAE(NPeriods=1,NSpectra=100,Rate=20,NEvents=1000)
        except RuntimeError:
            pass

    def captureLive():
        ConfigService.setFacility("TEST_LIVE")

        try:
            # start a Live data listener updating every second, that rebins the data
            # and replaces the results each time with those of the last second.
            StartLiveData(Instrument='ISIS_Event', OutputWorkspace='wsOut', UpdateEvery=1,
                          ProcessingAlgorithm='Rebin', ProcessingProperties='Params=10000,1000,20000;PreserveEvents=1',
                          AccumulationMethod='Add', PreserveEvents=True)

            # give it a couple of seconds before stopping it
            time.sleep(2)
        finally:
            # This will cancel both algorithms
            # you can do the same in the GUI
            # by clicking on the details button on the bottom right
            AlgorithmManager.newestInstanceOf("MonitorLiveData").cancel()
            AlgorithmManager.newestInstanceOf("FakeISISEventDAE").cancel()
            time.sleep(1)
    #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    oldFacility = ConfigService.getFacility().name()
    thread = Thread(target = startFakeDAE)
    thread.start()
    time.sleep(2) # give it a small amount of time to get ready
    if not thread.is_alive():
        raise RuntimeError("Unable to start FakeDAE")

    try:
        captureLive()
    except Exception:
        print("Error occurred starting live data")
    finally:
        thread.join() # this must get hit

    # put back the facility
    ConfigService.setFacility(oldFacility)

    #get the output workspace
    wsOut = mtd["wsOut"]
    print("The workspace contains %i events" % wsOut.getNumberEvents())

Output:

.. testoutput:: exStartLiveDataEvent
   :options: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    The workspace contains ... events



**Example 2:**

.. testcode:: exStartLiveDataHisto

    from threading import Thread
    import time

    def startFakeDAE():
        # This will generate 5 periods of histogram data, 10 spectra in each period,
        # 100 bins in each spectrum
        try:
            FakeISISHistoDAE(NPeriods=5,NSpectra=10,NBins=100)
        except RuntimeError:
            pass

    def captureLive():
        ConfigService.setFacility("TEST_LIVE")

        try:
            # Start a Live data listener updating every second,
            # that replaces the results each time with those of the last second.
            # Load only spectra 2,4, and 6 from periods 1 and 3
            StartLiveData(Instrument='ISIS_Histogram', OutputWorkspace='wsOut', UpdateEvery=1,
                          AccumulationMethod='Replace', PeriodList=[1,3],SpectraList=[2,4,6])

            # give it a couple of seconds before stopping it
            time.sleep(2)
        finally:
            # This will cancel both algorithms
            # you can do the same in the GUI
            # by clicking on the details button on the bottom right
            AlgorithmManager.newestInstanceOf("MonitorLiveData").cancel()
            AlgorithmManager.newestInstanceOf("FakeISISHistoDAE").cancel()
            time.sleep(1)
    #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    oldFacility = ConfigService.getFacility().name()
    thread = Thread(target = startFakeDAE)
    thread.start()
    time.sleep(2) # give it a small amount of time to get ready
    if not thread.is_alive():
        raise RuntimeError("Unable to start FakeDAE")

    try:
        captureLive()
    except Exception:
        print("Error occurred starting live data")
    finally:
        thread.join() # this must get hit

    # put back the facility
    ConfigService.setFacility(oldFacility)

    #get the output workspace
    wsOut = mtd["wsOut"]
    print("The workspace contains %i periods" % wsOut.getNumberOfEntries())
    print("Each period   contains %i spectra" % wsOut.getItem(0).getNumberHistograms())
    time.sleep(1)

Output:

.. testoutput:: exStartLiveDataHisto
   :options: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    The workspace contains ... periods
    Each period   contains ... spectra
