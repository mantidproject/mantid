Description

Bin-by-bin mode
###############

In this, the default scenario, each spectrum in the workspace is
normalised on a bin-by-bin basis by the monitor spectrum given. The
error on the monitor spectrum is taken into account. The normalisation
scheme used is:

:math:`(s_i)_{Norm}=(\frac{s_i}{m_i})*\Delta w_i*\frac{\sum_i{m_i}}{\sum_i(\Delta w_i)}`

where :math:`s_i` is the signal in a bin, :math:`m_i` the count in the
corresponding monitor bin, :math:`\Delta w_i` the bin width,
:math:`\sum_i{m_i}` the integrated monitor count and
:math:`\sum_i{\Delta w_i}` the sum of the monitor bin widths. In words,
this means that after normalisation each bin is multiplied by the bin
width and the total monitor count integrated over the entire frame, and
then divided by the total frame width. This leads to a normalised
histogram which has unit of counts, as before.

If the workspace does not have common binning, then the monitor spectrum
is rebinned internally to match each data spectrum prior to doing the
normalisation.

If a bin in the monitor spectrum contains 0 counts there is no special
treatment, only a warning is logged. The following options are available to deal
with the issue:

- Smooth the monitor spectrum before normalisation (using for example :ref:`algm-FFTSmooth`, :ref:`algm-SmoothData`, :ref:`algm-SplineSmoothing` algorithms).
- Replace the infinite numbers and NaNs after normalisation (:ref:`algm-ReplaceSpecialValues` algorithm).

Normalisation by integrated count mode
######################################

This mode is used if one or both of the relevant 'IntegrationRange'
optional parameters are set. If either is set to a value outside the
workspace range, then it will be reset to the frame minimum or maximum,
as appropriate.

The error on the integrated monitor spectrum is taken into account in
the normalisation. No adjustment of the overall normalisation takes
place, meaning that the output values in the output workspace are
technically dimensionless.

Restrictions on the input workspace
###################################

The data must be histogram, non-distribution data. The exception to the histogram requirement is for workspaces that contain point data with
a single count per spectrum. In this case the normalisation is performed by dividing every spectrum by the monitor counts, taking into
account the error on the monitor counts.

Detector Scan Workspaces
########################

Workspaces that have scanning detectors are supported by this algorithm, both for bin-by-bin mode and normlisation by integrated
count. The only option for specifying the monitor is by 'MonitorID', attempting to use 'MonitorSpectrum' or MonitorWorkspaceIndex'
will throw an error. In this case the 'NormFactorWS' output will contain a monitor spectrum for each time index.

Child Algorithms used
#####################

The :ref:`algm-ExtractSpectra` algorithm is used
to pull out the monitor spectrum if it's part of the InputWorkspace or
MonitorWorkspace. For the 'integrated range' option, the
:ref:`algm-Integration` algorithm is used to integrate the monitor
spectrum.

.. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

**Example - Normalise to Monitor ID=1**

.. testcode:: exNormaliseToMonitorSimple

   ws =Load('IRS26173.raw')

   wsN = NormaliseToMonitor( ws, MonitorID=1 )

   print("Without normalisation")
   print("Monitor ID=1 {:.3f}, {:.3f}".format(ws.readY(0)[0], ws.readY(0)[1]))
   print("Selected data {:.6f}, {:.6f}".format(ws.readY(6)[0], ws.readY(3)[1]))

   print("With Normalisation")
   print("Monitor ID=1 {:.3f}, {:.3f}".format(wsN.readY(0)[0], wsN.readY(0)[1]))
   print("Selected data {:.6f}, {:.6f}".format(wsN.readY(6)[0], wsN.readY(3)[1]))

Output:

.. testoutput:: exNormaliseToMonitorSimple

   Without normalisation
   Monitor ID=1 626034.000, 626681.000
   Selected data 2.000000, 1.000000
   With Normalisation
   Monitor ID=1 464872.441, 464872.441
   Selected data 1.485135, 0.741801
