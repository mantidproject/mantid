Output:

.. testoutput:: Min

    Minima for spectrum 0 is Y =  0.0  and it occurs at X between  2.0  and  3.0
    Minima for spectrum 1 is Y =  1.0  and it occurs at X between  4.0  and  5.0
    The new output workspace has  1  histogram, with the minimum Y =  2.0  and it occurs at X between  2.0  and  3.0
