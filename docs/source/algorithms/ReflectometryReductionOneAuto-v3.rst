Description
-----------

This algorithm is a facade over :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOne` (see :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOne`
for more information on the wrapped algorithm). It optionally corrects the detector position and then pulls numeric
parameters out of the instrument parameter file where possible. These automatically applied defaults
can be overridden by providing your own values. In addition, it outputs a rebinned workspace in Q, and it optionally
performs polarization analysis if the input workspace is a workspace group. The input and transmission workspaces can also be optionally
corrected for flood using :ref:`algm-ApplyFloodWorkspace` algorithm. The flood workspace either can be provided in :literal:`FloodWorkspace`
property or it is created on the fly with the :ref:`algm-CreateFloodWorkspace` algorithm using properties stored in the instrument
parameter file.

First, if :literal:`ThetaIn` is given the algorithm will try to correct the detector position. For this, it uses
:literal:`ProcessingInstructions`, which corresponds to the grouping pattern of workspace indices that define the
detectors of interest. Only the detectors of interest will be corrected, the rest of the instrument components
will remain in the original position. Note that when :literal:`ProcessingInstructions` is not set, its value
is inferred from other properties, depending on the value of :literal:`AnalysisMode`:

* If :literal:`AnalysisMode = PointDetectorAnalaysis` the algorithm will search for :literal:`PointDetectorStart` and :literal:`PointDetectorStop` in the parameter file, and :literal:`ProcessingInstructions` will be set to :literal:`PointDetectorStart:PointDetectorEnd`.
* If :literal:`AnalysisMode = MultiDetectorAnalaysis` the algorithm will search for :literal:`MultiDetectorStart` in the parameter file and all of the spectra from this value onwards will be used.

Note that ProcessingInstructions are workspace indices, not detector IDs. The first few workspaces may correspond
to monitors, rather than detectors of interest. For the syntax of this property, see :ref:`algm-GroupDetectors`.

:literal:`theta` is calculated using :literal:`SpecularReflectionCalculateTheta`. This is passed through to :literal:`ReflectometryReductionOne` and :literal:`2 * theta` is passed through to :literal:`CalculateResolution`. :literal:`theta` can be overridden by setting :literal:`ThetaIn` or :literal:`ThetaLogName` (:literal:`ThetaIn` takes precedence if both are given). If :literal:`CorrectDetectors` is also true, then the algorithm corrects the positions of the detectors of interest to :literal:`2 * theta` using :ref:`algm-SpecularReflectionPositionCorrect`. The detectors are moved either by shifting them vertically, or by rotating them around the sample position, as specified by :literal:`DetectorCorrectionType`.

Next, the algorithm will try to populate input properties which have not been set. Specifically, it will search for
:literal:`LambdaMin`, :literal:`LambdaMax`, :literal:`I0MonitorIndex`, :literal:`MonitorBackgroundMin`, :literal:`MonitorBackgroundMax`,
:literal:`MonitorIntegralMin` and :literal:`MonitorIntegralMin` in the parameter file to populate :literal:`WavelengthMin`,
:literal:`WavelengthMax`, :literal:`I0MonitorIndex`, :literal:`MonitorBackgroundWavelengthMin`, :literal:`MonitorBackgroundWavelengthMax`,
:literal:`MonitorIntegrationWavelengthMin` and :literal:`MonitorIntegrationWavelengthMax` respectively. The first two properties
will be used by :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOne` to crop the workspace in wavelength, whereas the rest of the properties
refer to monitors and are used to create a temporary monitor workspace by which the detectors of interest will be normalized.
Note that there is an additional property referring to monitors, :literal:`NormalizeByIntegratedMonitors`, which can be used
to specify whether or not integrated monitors should be considered.

The rest of the input properties are not inferred from the parameter file, and must be specified manually. :literal:`RegionOfDirectBeam` is an optional
property that allows users to specify a region of direct beam that will be used to normalize
the detector signal. The region of direct beam is specified by workspace indices. For instance, :literal:`RegionOfDirectBeam='2-3'`
means that spectra with workspace indices :literal:`2` and :literal:`3` will be summed and the resulting
workspace will be used as the direct beam workspace.

Transmission corrections can be optionally applied by providing either one or
two transmission runs or polynomial corrections. Polynomial correction is enabled by setting the
:literal:`CorrectionAlgorithm` property. If set to :literal:`AutoDetect`, the algorithm looks at the instrument
parameters for the :literal:`correction` parameter. If this parameter is set to
:literal:`polynomial`, then polynomial correction is performed using the
:ref:`algm-PolynomialCorrection` algorithm, with the polynomial string taken
from the instrument's :literal:`polystring` parameter. If the
:literal:`correction` parameter is set to :literal:`exponential` instead, then
the :Ref:`algm-ExponentialCorrection` algorithm is used, with C0 and C1 taken
from the instrument parameters, :literal:`C0` and :literal:`C1`. All these values
can be specified manually by setting the :literal:`CorrectionAlgorithm` to either
:literal:`PolynomialCorrection` or :literal:`ExponentialCorrection` and setting
:literal:`Polynomial` or :literal:`C0` and :literal:`C1` properties accordingly.
Note that when using a correction algorithm, monitors will not be integrated, even if
:literal:`NormalizeByIntegratedMonitors` was set to true.

:literal:`OutputWorkspace` is scaled to :literal:`ScaleFactor` and cropped to
:literal:`MomentumTransferMin` and/or :literal:`MomentumTransferMax`, if they
are given.

:literal:`OutputWorkspaceBinned` is rebinned to the resolution specified by
:literal:`MomentumTransferStep`, if it is given; otherwise the algorithm
attempts to determine the bin width using :ref:`algm-NRCalculateSlitResolution`
(note that to calculate the resolution this way, a :literal:`slit` component
with a `vertical gap` must be defined in the instrument definition file - if it
cannot be found, rebinning will not be done and a warning will be
logged). `MomentumTransferMin` and `MomentumTransferMax` are used for the rebin
if provided; otherwise the original min/max in Q is retained.

See :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOne` for more information
on how the input properties are used by the wrapped algorithm.

Workspace Groups
################

If a workspace group is provided as input, each workspace in the group will be
reduced independently and sequentially using :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOne`. Each of these
individual reductions will produce three output workspaces: an output workspace in
wavelength, an output workspace in Q with native binning, and a rebinned workspace in Q.
Output workspaces in wavelength will be grouped together to produce an output workspace group in wavelength, and output
workspaces in Q will be grouped together to produce an output workspace group in Q.
The diagram below illustrates this process (note that, for the sake of clarity, the rebinned output
workspace in Q, :literal:`OutputWorkspaceBinned`, is not represented but it is handled analogously to
:literal:`OutputWorkspace` and :literal:`OutputWorkspaceWavelength`):

.. diagram:: ReflectometryReductionOneAuto-v2-Groups_wkflw.dot

Note that if transmission runs are given in the form of a workspace group, then
the first element in the group will be used on every input workspace. If
transmission runs are provided as matrix workspaces the specified runs will be
used for all members of the input workspace group.

Polarization Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If :literal:`PolarizationAnalysis` is set to false the reduction stops. If it
is set to true, the reduction continues and polarization corrections will be
applied to the workspace that was output in wavelength. This uses the method
and values specified in the parameters file to run
:ref:`algm-PolarizationCorrectionFredrikze` or
:ref:`algm-PolarizationCorrectionWildes` as appropriate.

The result will be a new workspace in wavelength, which will override the
previous one. This will then be used as an input to re-run
:ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOne` to calculate the new output workspaces in
Q, which in turn will override the existing workspaces in Q. Note that when run
with a workspace that is already summed and converted to wavelength,
`algm-ReflectometryReductionOne` will not re-run these steps, so it is only the
conversion to Q that is run again. Transmission and algorithm corrections are
also skipped on the second run through because they have already been applied.
