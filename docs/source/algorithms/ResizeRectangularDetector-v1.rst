Description
-----------

This algorithm will resize a
:ref:`RectangularDetector <RectangularDetector>` by applying X and Y
scaling factors. Each pixel's position will be modified relative to the
0,0 point of the detector by these factors. Typically, a
RectangularDetector is constructed around its center, so this would
scale the detector around its center.

This only works on :ref:`RectangularDetectors <RectangularDetector>`. Banks
formed by e.g. tubes cannot be scaled in this way.

Internally, this sets the "scalex" and "scaley" parameters on the
:ref:`RectangularDetector <RectangularDetector>`. Note that the scaling is
relative to the original size, and is not cumulative: that is, if you
Resize \* 2 and again \* 3, your final detector is 3 times larger than
the original, not 6 times.

Note: As of this writing, the algorithm does NOT modify the shape of
individual pixels. This means that algorithms based on solid angle
calculations might be off. Ray-tracing (e.g. peak finding) are
unaffected.

             to move components.

Usage
-----

**Example - Resize bank 1:**

.. testcode:: ExScaleBank1

	# a sample workspace with rectangular detectors
	ws = CreateSampleWorkspace()

	ResizeRectangularDetector(ws,"bank1",2.0,0.5)

	i=ws.getInstrument()
	bank1=i.getComponentByName('bank1')
	bank2=i.getComponentByName('bank2')

	print ("bank 1 was scaled and is now {:.2f} by {:.2f}".format(bank1.xsize(), bank1.ysize()))
	print ("bank 2 was not scaled and remains {:.2f} by {:.2f}".format(bank2.xsize(), bank2.ysize()))

Output:

.. testoutput:: ExScaleBank1

	bank 1 was scaled and is now 0.16 by 0.04
	bank 2 was not scaled and remains 0.08 by 0.08
