Description
-----------

RadiusSum sums the counts in rings against radius.

Below, there is an example of the execution of the RadiusSum to a
:ref:`Workspace2D <Workspace2D>`
where the position of the pixels are not associated to detector
positions, but it is derived from the Axes.

algorithm

The Algorithm create **NumBins** rings around the **Centre** point each
one with :math:`width = BinSize` for
:math:`BinSize=\frac{MaxRadius-MinRadius}{NumBins}`.

The algorithm applies a rudimentary calculation to define the bin for
each that each pixel or detector in the
:ref:`Workspace2D <Workspace2D>`,
but taking its center point. If the center point belongs to one bin, it
is considered that the whole pixel belongs to the bin. The picture
below, shows what does this means. An ideal solution for RadiusSum is
the left image, while the right image is what is current implemented.

Although the images were applied to an image
:ref:`Workspace2D <Workspace2D>`, the
image below shows that it is possible to apply this algorithm to
Workspaces attached to instruments.
