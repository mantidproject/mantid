.. code-block:: python

    # Assuming you have previously logged into the catalog.
    my_data = CatalogMyDataSearch()

    # Verify that we have any investigations in 'My Data'
    print("The number of investigations in 'My data' is: {}".format(len(my_data)))

    # Output the title of each investigation in 'My data'
    for row in my_data:
        print("The title of the investigation is: {}".format(row['Title']))
