Description
-----------

Performs azimuthal averaging for a 2D SANS data set by going through
each wavelength bin of each detector pixel, determining its Q-value, and adding its amplitude
:math:`I` to the appropriate Q bin. The algorithm works both for monochromatic and TOF SANS data.

Note that the algorithm performs averaging in 2 steps.
First, for each wavelength slice of the input it performs azimuthal averaging in radial rings.
This results in a stack of I(Q)s, one for each input wavelength.
As a second step, all the I(Q)s corresponding to different wavelengths are averaged again.
Note that for the TOF data, this is mathematically not equivalent to performing averaging with one step; that is averaging everything into a single I(Q) histogram.
The latter is done in :ref:`Q1D <algm-Q1D>` algorithm.
See the :ref:`Rebin <algm-Rebin>` documentation for details about choosing the ``OutputBinning`` parameter.

Usage
-----

This algorithm is used as a part of the :ref:`SANSReduction <algm-HFIRSANSReduction-v1>` and :ref:`SANSILLIntegration <algm-SANSILLIntegration>`.
However, it can also be used directly, provided that the input data is already corrected for all the effects.

I/O
---

The input to this algorithm must be a histogram with common wavelength bins for each pixel.
The output will be a distribution though.

Additional options
------------------

NPixelDivision
##############

For greater precision, each detector
pixel can be sub-divided in sub-pixels by setting the ``NPixelDivision``
parameters. This will split each pixel to a grid of ``NPixelDivision`` * ``NPixelDivision`` pixels.
``PixelSizeX`` and ``PixelSizeY`` inputs will be used only if pixels are to be split.

ErrorWeighting
##############

Each pixel has a weight of 1 by default, but the weight of
each pixel can be set to :math:`1/\sigma^2 I` by setting the
``ErrorWeighting`` parameter to True. This will effectively transmute the average to a weighted average, where the weight is inversely proportional to the absolute statistical uncertainty on the intensity.
This option will potentially produce very different results, so care must be taken when analysing the data with this option.
In the reduction workflows this option is deprecated.

Wedges
######

For anisotropic scatterer, the *I(Q)* can be calculated for different angular sectors (or wedges).

These sectors can be defined in two different ways : either by drawing them, or by defining them.
There are also two integration mode: symmetric wedges (default) or asymmetric wedges.

Defining wedges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wedges are defined by the ``NumberOfWedges``, ``WedgeAngle`` and ``WedgeOffset`` parameters.
The trigonometrical circle is split in ``NumberOfWedges`` sectors, equally spaced, spanning a range of ``WedgeAngle``.

Drawing sectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option is still in active development, and might be subject to changes in later versions.
It is also possible to use the instrument viewer to draw the shape of the angular sector. Only sector shapes are currently supported,
and they must be drawn in the Full 3D, Z- projection, without any rotation (translation and zoom are supported). Please
note that in this projection, the X-axis points to the left. So when doing the wedges without the table (see above), they are ordered
clockwise, opening from the positive ray of the X-axis.
If running Q1DWeighted with drawn sectors as input, the output will be ordered similarly, regardless of the order in which they were drawn.
Once the shapes are drawn, they must be saved using the ``Save shapes to table`` button.

Contrary to the wedges defined in the previous manner, the sectors don't need to be regularly placed, centered or even symmetrical.

When running ``Q1DWeighted``, the created table workspace - generally named `MaskShapes` - can be provided
as an argument to the ``ShapeTable`` field. The algorithm will then use the drawn shapes as wedges, and ignore ``NumberOfWedges``,
``WedgeAngle`` and ``WedgeOffset`` fields.

Symmetric
~~~~~~~~~

Symmetric or asymmetric integration is determined by the `AsymmetricWedges` flag.


The figure below illustrates an example for symmetric wedges. Each wedge in this case represents two back-to-back sectors.
The wedges output group will have two workspaces: one for the red region, one for the blue region.

  :align: center
  :width: 600

In the case of drawn sectors, when doing symmetric integration, symmetric shapes will be grouped together.
Taking the above example, the shape table will have 4 shapes in it, but the output will only have 2 workspaces, because the
red shapes and the blue shapes will be grouped.
If no corresponding symmetric is found for a shape, the algorithm will nonetheless integrate on the projected symmetric too,
so the result will be identical (though for clarity it is not advised to provide only one of the shapes).
Again, in the above example, the result will be identical whether only one or both of the red and blue shapes are provided,
because the algorithm will find the missing symmetric if needed.

Asymmetric
~~~~~~~~~~

An example for asymmetric wedges is shown below. The output will have four workspaces, one per each sector of different color.

Masked Bins
###########

Bins masked in the input workspace will not enter the calculation.

If enabled, this will correct for the gravity effect by analytical calculation of the drop during the time-of-flight from sample to detector.
