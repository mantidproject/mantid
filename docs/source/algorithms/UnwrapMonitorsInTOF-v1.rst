Description
-----------

This algorithm is for use with white-beam instruments with choppers. When setting two different
time regimes for monitors and detectors it can occur that neutrons from the previous frame
are detected by monitors further down the beam line. Note that this algorithm currently only
operates well on linearly binned monitor data.

The schematic illustration below explains the situation. Two pulses are in the beam line
at the same time. All monitors are operating in the same time regime. This means that
while a monitor closer to the source starts detecting neutrons associated with the current frame,
a monitor further down the beam line might be detecting neutrons associated with the previous frame as
is depicted in illustration a) below.

This means that the measured signal for a monitor further down the beam line can be comprised of data from
two sequential frames. It will be chopped up as is depicted in illustration b) below.

This algorithm duplicates the data and appends it to itself. This means that the TOF is essentially doubled
(in the case of linear time binning). This is depicted in illustration a) below. This means that we now
have data in the monitors which is not physical, i.e. some monitors seem to have measured data for certain
time-of-flight values which are not accessible for the wavelength range of the apperatus and the locations of the monitors.
Therefore the user can specify the wavelength range of the apperatus. This is translated into the effective
time-of-flight range of each monitor and data outside of this range is set to zero. This is illustrated in image b) below.

Usage
-----

**Example - UnwrapMonitorsInTOF**

.. testcode:: UnwrapMonitorsInTOFExample

  import os

  # Create a sample SANS2D workspace
  sans2D_path = os.path.join(ConfigService.getInstrumentDirectory(),"SANS2D_Definition.xml")
  workspace = LoadEmptyInstrument(sans2D_path)
  workspace = Rebin(workspace, "1,10000, 100000")

  # Set monitor 4  (at workspace index 3) to  [3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4]
  dataY = workspace.dataY(3)
  y_values = [3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4]
  for index in range(0, 10):
      dataY[index] = y_values [index]


  # Apply the UnwrapMonitorsInTOF algorithm
  output_workspace = UnwrapMonitorsInTOF(InputWorkspace=workspace, WavelengthMin=5, WavelengthMax=20)

  # Inspect the unwrapped data
  dataY_doubled = output_workspace.dataY(3)
  print("The number of bins is {0} and is expected to be 20.".format(len(dataY_doubled)))
  print("The monitor 4 entries are: {0}.".format(dataY_doubled))

Output:

.. testoutput:: UnwrapMonitorsInTOFExample

  The number of bins is 20 and is expected to be 20.
  The monitor 4 entries are: [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  5.  4.  3.  2.  1.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.
    0.  0.].
