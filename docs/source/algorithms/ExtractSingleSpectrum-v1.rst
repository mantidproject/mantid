Description
-----------

Extracts a single spectrum from a :ref:`Workspace2D <Workspace2D>` and
stores it in a new workspace.

Usage
-----

**Example**

.. testcode:: ExExtractSingleSpectrum

    ws = CreateSampleWorkspace()
    print("Workspace %s contains %i spectra" % (ws, ws.getNumberHistograms()))
    print("Counts for every 10th bin for workspace index 5")
    print(", ".join(["{:.1f}".format(y) for y in ws.readY(5)[0:100:10]]))

    wsOut = ExtractSingleSpectrum(ws,WorkspaceIndex=5)
    print("After extracting one spectra at workspace index 5")

    print("Workspace %s contains %i spectra" % (wsOut, wsOut.getNumberHistograms()))
    print("Counts for every 10th bin for workspace index 0 (now it's 0 as wsOut only contains 1 spectra)")
    print(", ".join(["{:.1f}".format(y) for y in wsOut.readY(0)[0:100:10]]))


Output:

.. testoutput:: ExExtractSingleSpectrum

    Workspace ws contains 200 spectra
    Counts for every 10th bin for workspace index 5
    0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 10.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3
    After extracting one spectra at workspace index 5
    Workspace wsOut contains 1 spectra
    Counts for every 10th bin for workspace index 0 (now it's 0 as wsOut only contains 1 spectra)
    0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 10.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3
