Description
-----------

This algorithm calibrates the detector pixels and creates a
:ref:`diffraction calibration workspace
<DiffractionCalibrationWorkspace>`. Unlike
:ref:`algm-CalibrateRectangularDetectors` the peak fitting and
calibration is done in TOF not d spacing. The peak d values are
converted to TOF based on either the old calibration or the instrument
geometry. The SignalFile or SignalWorkspace contains the data from a
standard sample. The results are then fitted with up to difc, t_zero
and difa, these values are details in :ref:`algm-AlignDetectors`.

The peak fitting properties are explained in
:ref:`algm-FindPeaks`. This also uses the same criteria on peaks as
:ref:`algm-GetDetOffsetsMultiPeaks`.

A mask workspace is created, named "OutputCalibrationTable" + '_mask',
with uncalibrated pixels masked.

The resulting calibration table can be saved with
:ref:`algm-SaveDiffCal`, loaded with :ref:`algm-LoadDiffCal` and
applied to a workspace with :ref:`algm-AlignDetectors`.

Usage
-----
..  Try not to use files in your examples,
    but if you cannot avoid it then the (small) files must be added to
    autotestdata\UsageData and the following tag unindented
    .. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

**Example - PDCalibration**

.. code-block:: python

   # If you have a old calibration it can be used as the starting point
   oldCal = 'NOM_calibrate_d72460_2016_05_23.h5'

   # list of d values for diamond
   dvalues = (0.3117,0.3257,0.3499,0.4205,0.4645,0.4768,0.4996,0.5150,0.5441,0.5642,0.5947,0.6307,.6866,.7283,.8185,.8920,1.0758,1.2615,2.0599)

   PDCalibration(SignalWorkspace='uncalibrated',
                 SignalFile='NOM_72460',
                 TofBinning=[300,-.001,16666.7],
                 PreviousCalibration=oldCal,
                 PeakPositions=dvalues,
                 OutputCalibrationTable='cal')

   # Print the result
   print("The calibrated difc at detid {detid} is {difc}".format(**mtd['cal'].row(40000)))

Output:

.. code-block:: none

  The calibrated difc at detid 40896 is 5522.64160156
