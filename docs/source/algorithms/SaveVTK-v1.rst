Description
-----------

Saves a workspace out to a VTK file that can be loaded with Paraview or
any other software supporting the VTK file format. This is a very basic
algorithm that simple creates a 3D view of the data as a series of
histograms. It should only be used for relatively small data sets as the
resulting file can become quite large relatively quickly.
