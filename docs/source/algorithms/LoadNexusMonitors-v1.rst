Description
-----------

This algorithm loads all monitors found in a NeXus file into a single
:ref:`Workspace2D <Workspace2D>` (if there is no event data) or into
an :ref:`EventWorkspace <EventWorkspace>` (if event monitor data is
found).  The algorithm assumes that all of the monitors are histograms
and have the same bin boundaries. **NOTE:** The entry is assumed to be
in SNS or ISIS format, so the loader is currently not generically
applicable. It is also written for single entry files and will need
tweaking to handle period data where the monitors are different.

Usage
-----

.. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

.. testcode:: Ex

    ws = LoadNexusMonitors("CNCS_7860_event.nxs")
    # CNCS has 3 monitors
    print "Number of monitors =", ws.getNumberHistograms()

Output:

.. testoutput:: Ex

    Number of monitors = 3
