Description
-----------

This is the algorithm that performs wavelength and position calibration for both individual detectors and detector banks using measurement of a sample of powdered :math:`\text{Y}_{3}\text{Fe}_{5}\text{O}_{12}` (YIG). This data is fitted with Gaussian distributions at the expected peak positions. The output is an :ref:`Instrument Parameter File <InstrumentParameterFile>` readable by the :ref:`LoadILLPolarizedDiffraction <algm-LoadILLPolarizedDiffraction>` algorithm that will place the detector banks and detectors using the output of this algorithm. The algorithm implements method described in Ref. [#Fennell]_.

It is crucial for a reliable calibration to first run a test without setting the `BankOffsets` parameter and with `FittingMethod` set to `None`. This allows checking the positions of the initial guesses for the positions of YIG Bragg peaks in the `conjoined_input` workspace. Then, the BankOffsets can be obtained by comparing the peak positions coming from the detectors with their expected location, coming from known d-spacings for YIG.

Currently the algorithm is focused on the D7 instrument that has three detector banks and a monitor, and all of them can move individually. The detector position and wavelength calibration have to be checked each time the used wavelength is changed, since the instrument has to be manually moved into a different parking position around the monochromator.

The property `MaskedBinsRange` allows to mask multiple :math:`2\theta` ranges of the :math:`2\theta` scan. If the number of provided arguments is even, arguments will be paired and the angular range between the first and the second element of the pair will be masked, and for all pairs. In the case where the number of arguments is odd, the first argument is assumed to be a lower cut-off, and all :math:`2\theta` detector positions below that value will be masked.

Calibration method
##################

A YIG scan data is loaded into a single 2D Workspace where the X axis contains detector positions during each step of the scan, and the Y axis the measured intensities normalized to monitor. The Y axis data is also 2D with each row representing full scan for a single detector. It is recommended to mask scan points located between -35 and 15 degrees to remove the impact of the direct neutron beam.

The provided YIG d-spacing values are loaded from an XML list. The default d-spacing is coming from Ref. [#Nakatsuka]_. The peak positions are converted into 2theta positions using the initial assumption of the neutron wavelength. All peaks that would require the :math:`2\theta` to be above 180 degrees are removed.

YIG peaks in the detector's scan are fitted using a Gaussian distribution. The Bragg peaks are fitted either separately, when the `FittingMethod` property is set to `Individual`, or all peaks measured by a detector are fitted together, when the `FittingMethod` property is set to `Global`. The fitting results are stored in a new workspace, where the Y axis contains the fitted peak centres and the X axis the calculated peak positions.

The workspace containing the peak fitting results is then fitted using a `Multidomain` function of the form:

.. math:: 2\theta_{\text{fit}} = m \cdot (2.0 \cdot \text{asin} ( \lambda / 2d ) + offset_{\text{pixel}} + offset_{\text{bank}}),

where `m` is the bank slope, :math:`offset_{\text{pixel}}` is the relative offset to the initial assumption of the position inside the detector bank, and :math:`offset_{\text{bank}}` is the offset of the entire bank. This function allows to extract the information about the wavelength, detector bank slopes and offsets, and the distribution of detector offsets.
