Description
-----------

This algorithm uses ``PyCifRW`` to parse the supplied CIF-file and extract the information necessary to construct a
``CrystalStructure`` object that is attached to the supplied workspace. For successfully loading a crystal structure,
the CIF-file must contain some mandatory fields, describing the three components that define the structure.

**Unit cell**

For the unit cell, at least *_cell_length_a* must be present. If *_cell_length_b* or *_cell_length_c* are absent, the
value is replaced with the one of *_cell_length_a*. Any absent item of *_cell_angle_alpha*, *_cell_angle_beta* or
*_cell_angle_gamma* is replaced with 90.

**Space group**

The space group is currently loaded based on one of the fields *_space_group_name_H-M_alt* or
*_symmetry_space_group_name_H-M*, where the former has precedence over the latter. The value has to correspond to one
of the registered space groups in Mantid (see the corresponding :ref:`concept page <Point and space groups>`).

If neither of the fields is present, the loader tries to recover by using the space group number in either
*_symmetry_int_tables_number* or *_space_group_it_number* where again, the former has precedence. This only works if
there is only one setting registered for the specified space group type, because otherwise the algorithm can not decide
which one to use.

**Atoms**

There needs to be a *loop_* with at least the following fields: *_atom_site_label*, *_atom_site_fract_x*,
*_atom_site_fract_y* and *_atom_site_fract_z*. Additionally, *_atom_site_type_symbol*, *_atom_site_occupancy* and
*_atom_site_U_iso_or_equiv* and *_atom_site_B_iso_or_equiv* (internally converted to U by dividing by :math:`8\pi^2`
are recognized. The labels are expected to contain the element symbol, any non-letter characters (numbers, special
characters) are removed. The *_atom_site_label* is only used for this purpose when *_atom_site_type_symbol*
is not present.

The algorithm can also compute :math:`U_{equiv}` from anisotropic ADPs [1]_ specified by the fields *_atom_site_aniso_u_11*,
*_atom_site_aniso_u_12*, *_atom_site_aniso_u_13*, *_atom_site_aniso_u_22*, *_atom_site_aniso_u_23* and
*_atom_site_aniso_u_33* (the :math:`B`-based variant is recognized too, if both are present, :math:`U` is used).
For this to work correctly, the field *_atom_site_aniso_label* has to be present and contain
the same strings as *_atom_site_label*. This calculation is only performed for atoms where the isotropic parameter is
missing or invalid. If neither isotropic nor anisotropic parameters are present for an atom, 0 is used.

Optionally, a UB-matrix can be loaded from the CIF-file and applied to the workspace via the SetUB-algorithm. For this,
the *_diffrn_orient_matrix_UB_xy* fields have to be set.

Required
--------

This algorithm requires python package ``PyCifRW``, available at the `python package index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyCifRW/4.1>`_
or through the operating system's package manager. If the package is not present, this algorithm will not be available.

Usage
-----

.. include:: ../usagedata-note.txt

The following script loads a CIF-file and prints the space group of the crystal structure:

.. code-block:: python

    sample_ws = CreateSampleWorkspace()
    LoadCIF(sample_ws, 'LoadCIF_example_file.cif')

    # Get the space group from the crystal structure that was loaded
    crystal_structure = sample_ws.sample().getCrystalStructure()

    print('Space group: {}'.format(crystal_structure.getSpaceGroup().getHMSymbol()))

The output is:

.. code-block:: python

    Space group: F d -3 m
