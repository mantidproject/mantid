Description
-----------

Simulates ISIS event DAE. It runs continuously until canceled and
listens to port 10000 for connection. When connected starts sending
event packets.

Events are randomly distributed between the following

- Periods
- Spectra
- time of flight between 10,000 and 20,000


Usage
-----

**Example:**

.. This test is currently hanging on macOS as the MonitorLiveData algorithm
   is taking a long time to cancel
.. .. testcode:: exFakeISISEventDAE

.. code-block:: python

    from threading import Thread
    import time

    def startFakeDAE():
        # This will generate 2000 events roughly every 20ms, so about 50,000 events/sec
        # They will be randomly shared across the 100 spectra
        # and have a time of flight between 10,000 and 20,000
        try:
            FakeISISEventDAE(NPeriods=1,NSpectra=100,Rate=20,NEvents=1000)
        except RuntimeError:
            pass

    def captureLive():
        ConfigService.setFacility("TEST_LIVE")

        try:
            # start a Live data listener updating every second, that rebins the data
            # and replaces the results each time with those of the last second.

                          AccumulationMethod='Add', PreserveEvents=True)

            # give it a couple of seconds before stopping it
            time.sleep(2)
        finally:
            # This will cancel both algorithms
            # you can do the same in the GUI
            # by clicking on the details button on the bottom right
            AlgorithmManager.newestInstanceOf("MonitorLiveData").cancel()
            AlgorithmManager.newestInstanceOf("FakeISISEventDAE").cancel()
            time.sleep(1)
    #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    oldFacility = ConfigService.getFacility().name()
    thread = Thread(target = startFakeDAE)
    thread.start()
    time.sleep(2) # give it a small amount of time to get ready
    if not thread.is_alive():
        raise RuntimeError("Unable to start FakeDAE")

    try:

    except:
        print("Error occurred starting live data")
    finally:
        thread.join() # this must get hit

    # put back the facility
    ConfigService.setFacility(oldFacility)

    #get the output workspace
    wsOut = mtd["wsOut"]
    print("The workspace contains %i events" % wsOut.getNumberEvents())

Output:

.. testoutput:: exFakeISISEventDAE
   :options: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    The workspace contains ... events
