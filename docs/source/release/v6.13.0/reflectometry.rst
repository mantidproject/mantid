New Features
------------
- A new field, ``Fredrikze Input Spin State Order``, has been added to the :ref:`Experiment Settings Tab <refl_exp_instrument_settings>` on the
  ISIS Reflectometry interface. This allows the spin state order of the input workspace group to be supplied when
  the reduction performs a Fredrikze polarisation correction.
- The flipper configuration for the input workspace group from the :ref:`interface-isis-refl`, when performing a Wildes
  polarisation correction, can now be passed to the reduction by adding a parameter called ``WildesFlipperConfig`` to
  your intrument's parameter file. Additionally, a default configuration of ``01,01,10,11`` has been added to POLREF's
  parameter file.
-  When a workspace is loaded on the ISIS Reflectometry GUI :ref:`Reduction Preview <refl_preview>` tab, region selectors are now added to the slice viewer plot to display any ROIs from matching experiment settings.
- The :ref:`algm-PolarizationEfficienciesWildes` algorithm now propagates errors correctly using the taylor series method (first order). A new helper class has been introduced to do this using the Eigen ``autodiff`` module to calculate partials.
- The :ref:`algm-SaveNXcanSAS` algorithm can also accept compatible Workspace Groups as input.
- A new :ref:`algm-ReflectometryISISCalculatePolEff` algorithm has been added. This algorithm provides a convenient
  wrapper for the :ref:`algm-ReflectometryISISCreateTransmission`, :ref:`algm-PolarizationEfficienciesWildes` and
  :ref:`algm-JoinISISPolarizationEfficiencies` algorithms.
