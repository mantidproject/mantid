- New verison of :ref:`algm-PoldiAutoCorrelation-v6` that supports the new detector geometry on POLDI post upgrade (in December 2024). For older POLDI data please use the previous version (:ref:`algm-PoldiAutoCorrelation-v5` by calling the algorithm with keyword argument Version=5).
- Helper functions in `poldi_utils` to load POLDI data post detector upgrade (currently ASCII format with no meta-data) and simulate the spectra in a :ref:`Workspace2D <Workspace2D>` from an input powder spectrum. The functions can be imported in a script like so ``from plugins.algorithms.poldi_utils import *``.
