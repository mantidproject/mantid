- When Focusing, either within the interface or in a script, you should no longer be able to unknowingly apply an outdated vanadium correction. Previously, when focusing had already been run on a user defined region of interest (Custom or Cropped), the vanadium correction was calculated and saved in the ADS as ``engggui_curves_Custom`` or ``engggui_curves_Cropped``. If this ROI was then updated and recalibrated, when focus was run again, it would load the existing ``engggui_curves`` from the ADS which would be from the old ROI. Now, the naming of these files should be more unique to the specific ROI, and in the case where a file is loaded from the ADS which may be wrong, a warning is supplied to the user.
