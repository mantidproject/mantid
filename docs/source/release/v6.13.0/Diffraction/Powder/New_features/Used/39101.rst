- Several improvements to :ref:`algm-PEARLTransfit`:

  - Perform an intial fit with fixed ``GaussianFWHM`` for calibration runs
  - Accounted for covariance in error calculation for effective temperature
  - Added new input parameter ``RebinInEnergy`` - if False then the energy bins will be determined from the TOF bins in the input workspace and not the ``Ediv`` parameter.
