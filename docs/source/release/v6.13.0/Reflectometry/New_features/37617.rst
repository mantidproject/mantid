- A new field, ``Fredrikze Input Spin State Order``, has been added to the :ref:`Experiment Settings Tab <refl_exp_instrument_settings>` on the
  ISIS Reflectometry interface. This allows the spin state order of the input workspace group to be supplied when
  the reduction performs a Fredrikze polarisation correction.
- The flipper configuration for the input workspace group from the :ref:`interface-isis-refl`, when performing a Wildes
  polarisation correction, can now be passed to the reduction by adding a parameter called ``WildesFlipperConfig`` to
  your intrument's parameter file. Additionally, a default configuration of ``01,01,10,11`` has been added to POLREF's
  parameter file.
