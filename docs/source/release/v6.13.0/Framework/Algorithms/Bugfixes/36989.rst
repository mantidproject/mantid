- `InstrumentArrayConverter` and `PeakData` utility classes used in peak integration algorithms have been moved into a common module located at `plugins.algorithms.peakdata_utils.py`. Import paths related to those classes need to be updated from `from plugins.algorithms.IntegratePeaksSkew import InstrumentArrayConverter, PeakData` into `from plugins.algorithms.peakdata_utils import InstrumentArrayConverter, PeakData`.
