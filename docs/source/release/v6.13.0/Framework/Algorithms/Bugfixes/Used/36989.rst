- ``InstrumentArrayConverter`` and ``PeakData`` utility classes used in peak integration algorithms have been moved into a common module located at ``plugins.algorithms.peakdata_utils.py``. Import paths related to those classes need to be updated from ``from plugins.algorithms.IntegratePeaksSkew import InstrumentArrayConverter, PeakData`` into ``from plugins.algorithms.peakdata_utils import InstrumentArrayConverter, PeakData``.
