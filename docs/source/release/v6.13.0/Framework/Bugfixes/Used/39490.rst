- ``saveNexus`` and ``loadNexus`` methods of :py:obj:`~mantid.geometry.Goniometer` object now directly save/load a copy of the rotation matrix. Previously, upon saving/loading, the :py:obj:`~mantid.geometry.Goniometer` would only deal with the rotation axes, leading to loss of rotation information if the :py:obj:`~mantid.geometry.Goniometer` had been defined using ``setR`` method, or similar approach.
