- Introduced a new python algorithm `RefineSingleCrystalGoniometer` that refines the UB-matrix and goniometer offsets simultaneously.
- Improvements:
    - Improves the indexing of the peaks for those cases when there is sample misorientation and `FindUBUsingIndexedPeaks` is insufficient.
- Key benefits:
    - Improved indexing of peaks in special cases.
