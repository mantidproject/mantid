- Makes the large offline documentation optional rather than a mandatory install, reducing installer/download size significantly.
- Improvements:
    - For users who frequently access online docs or have bandwidth constraints, this saves considerable disk space (potentially hundreds of MB).
    - Those who prefer local/offline usage can still opt to install the documentation package and continue working without internet access.
- Key benefits:
    - Greater flexibility in how Mantid is set up â€” you choose whether to save space or have fully locally built docs.
