What’s new:
    - Adds a clear indicator in the Help Window’s toolbar showing whether Mantid is displaying **Local Docs** or **Online Docs** documentation.
Improvements:
    - Makes it obvious if you are using locally installed documentation or viewing updated online docs (default).
    - Helps diagnose connection or installation issues if pages are not loading as expected.
Key benefits:
    - Immediate clarity on where help content is being retrieved from, removing guesswork.
