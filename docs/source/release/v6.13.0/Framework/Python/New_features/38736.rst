- Improvements:
    - Enhances the visual appearance and usability of in-app documentation.
    - Supports richer HTML content and modern formatting, including MathJax for rendering mathematical equations.
    - Delivers a smoother and more consistent experience when navigating help and reference material.
- Key benefits:
    - Improved clarity for technical content (e.g. math and tables), more attractive and readable pages, and future potential for interactive elements in documentation.
