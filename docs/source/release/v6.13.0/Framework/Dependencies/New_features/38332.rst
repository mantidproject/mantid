This release has replaced use of the `NeXus API <https://github.com/nexusformat/code>`_ with its own implementation that is heavily influenced from that code. There are two main purposes in no longer depending on the NeXus-API
  1. The API was `announced as only undergoing bugfixes as of 2014 <https://www.nexusformat.org/content/NIACAPI.html>`_ . The last release was `v4.4.3 <https://github.com/nexusformat/code/releases/tag/v4.4.3>`_ on 2016-09-12.
  2. In order to make changes to improve performance, mantid needs to change the underlying implementation calling hdf5.

The net effect is that we have a Nexus abstraction that only supports hdf5-based files, which are the vast majority of the files that needs to write, and a LegacyNexus abstraction which has reduced its support to hdf4 and hdf5 based files (dropping xml.
Much of this release cycle was spent creating the new abstraction and moving all existing code to use it.
Ideally, users should see very little difference except for small changes in performance for files that have many groups/datasets at a level within the file which will be better due to an in-memory cache of the data layout.
Those interested in the details of the changes can see them in the (developer centric) `github issue <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/issues/38332>`_.
