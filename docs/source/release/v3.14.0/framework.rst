    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

Logging
-------

- We have changed the logging in Mantid to stop writing the high level version of the log to a file.  This had been causing numerous problems including inconsistent behaviour with multiple instances of Mantid, performance problems when logging at detailed levels, and excessive network usage in some scenarios.  This does not change the rest of the logging that you see in the message display in Mantidplot or the console window. A warning message will appear if configuration for the removed components of logging is found.

  - Associated with this we have also simplified the python methods used to control logging.

    .. code-block:: python

	  	# The two methods
	  	ConfigService.SetConsoleLogLevel(int)
	  	ConfigService.SetFileLogLevel(int)

	  	# Have been replaced by
	  	ConfigService.SetLogLevel(int)

Nexus Geometry Loading
----------------------
:ref:`LoadEmptyInstrument <algm-LoadEmptyInstrument>` will now load instrument geometry from hdf5 `NeXus <https://www.nexusformat.org/>`_ format files. Files consistent with the standard following the introduction of `NXoff_geometry <http://download.nexusformat.org/sphinx/classes/base_classes/NXoff_geometry.html>`_ and `NXcylindrical_geometry <http://download.nexusformat.org/sphinx/classes/base_classes/NXcylindrical_geometry.html>`_ will be used to build the entire in-memory instrument geometry within Mantid. This IDF-free route is primarily envisioned for the ESS. This marks the completion of the first phase in the feasibility and rollout of support for the new format. Over coming releases we will be expanding our support for the NeXus geometry both across Loading and Saving algorithms. While dependent on the instrument, we are overall seeing significant improvements in instrument load times over loading from equivalent IDF based implementations.

Stability
---------


Algorithms
----------

New Algorithms
##############

- :ref:`MatchSpectra <algm-MatchSpectra>` is an algorithm that calculates factors to match all spectra to a reference spectrum.

Improvements
############

- :ref:`AppendSpectra <algm-AppendSpectra>` can append now multiple times the same event workspace.
- :ref:`CropToComponent <algm-CropToComponent>` now supports also scanning workspaces.
- :ref:`SumOverlappingTubes <algm-SumOverlappingTubes>` will produce histogram data, and will not split the counts between bins by default.
- :ref:`SumSpectra <algm-SumSpectra>` has an additional option, ``MultiplyBySpectra``, which controls whether or not the output spectra are multiplied by the number of bins. This property should be set to ``False`` for summing spectra as PDFgetN does.
- :ref:`Live Data <algm-StartLiveData>` for events with ``PreserveEvents=True`` now produces workspaces that have bin boundaries which encompass the total x-range (TOF) for all events across all spectra if the data was not binned during the process step.
- Bugfix in :ref:`ConvertToMatrixWorkspace <algm-ConvertToMatrixWorkspace>` with ``Workspace2D`` as the ``InputWorkspace`` not being cloned to the ``OutputWorkspace``. Added support for ragged workspaces.
- :ref:`RebinToWorkspace <algm-RebinToWorkspace>` now checks if the ``WorkspaceToRebin`` and ``WorkspaceToMatch`` already have the same binning. Added support for ragged workspaces.
- :ref:`GroupWorkspaces <algm-GroupWorkspaces>` supports glob patterns for matching workspaces in the ADS.
- :ref:`MaskDetectorsIf <algm-MaskDetectorsIf>` now supports masking a workspace in addition to writing the masking information to a calfile.

Bugfixes
########


- :ref:`SaveGDA <algm-SaveGDA>` Now takes a parameter of OutputFilename instead of Filename to better match with similar algorithms.

- :ref:`FilterEvents <algm-FilterEvents-v1>` output workspaces now contain the goniometer.
- Fixed an issue where if a workspace's history wouldn't update for some algorithms
- Fixed a ``std::bad_cast`` error in :ref:`algm-LoadLiveData` when the data size changes.
- :ref:`Fit <algm-Fit>` now applies the ties in correct order independently on the order they are set. If any circular dependencies are found Fit will give an error.
- Fixed a rare bug in :ref:`MaskDetectors <algm-MaskDetectors>` where a workspace could become invalidaded in Python if it was a ``MaskWorkspace``.


Python
------

New
###

- New python validator type: :class:`~mantid.geometry.OrientedLattice` checks whether a workspace has an oriented lattice object attached.
- We have been making major performance improvements to geometry access in Mantid over the last few releases. We are now exposing these features via Python to give our users direct access to the same benefits as part of their scripts. The newly exposed objects are now available via workspaces and include:

 * :class:`mantid.geometry.ComponentInfo`
 * :class:`mantid.geometry.DetectorInfo`
 * :class:`mantid.api.SpectrumInfo`

- :class:`mantid.geometry.ComponentInfo` is exposed to allow the user to access geometric information about the components which are part of a beamline.

- :class:`mantid.geometry.DetectorInfo` offers the user the ability to access geometric information about the detector(s) which are part of a beamline. ``DetectorInfo`` has also been given an iterator to allow users to write more Pythonic loops rather than normal index based loops.

- :class:`mantid.api.SpectrumInfo` allows the user to access information about the spectra being used in a beamline. ``SpectrumInfo`` has also been given an iterator to allow users to write more Pythonic loops rather than normal index based loops. In addition to this ``SpectrumDefinition`` objects can also be accessed via a :class:`mantid.api.SpectrumInfo` object. The ``SpectrumDefinition`` object can be used to obtain information about the spectrum to detector mapping and provides a definition of what a spectrum comprises, i.e. indices of all detectors that contribute to the data stored in the spectrum.


Improvements
############

- :ref:`ChudleyElliot <func-ChudleyElliot>` includes hbar in the definition
