- Added time standard deviation to the sample log dialog

Project Recovery
----------------
New
###
-Project recovery can now make a recovery checkpoint on command using mantidplot.app.saveRecoveryCheckpoint() in either the interpreter or script windows in python

Changes
#######
- Project Recovery will no longer save groups, this fixes an issue where it would cause crashes if you deleted a workspace from a group.
- MantidPlot no longer checks for the existence of files in the "Recent Files" menu. Fixes case where files on slow mounted network drives can cause a lag on MantidPlot startup.
- Workspaces now save locally as a number of how many workspaces have already been saved instead of workspace names
- Project Recovery will now attempt to recover multiple instances of mantid that are ran at the same time.

Bugfixes
########
- Workspaces with a '#' in their name will no longer cause issues in the loading of a recovered project
- Project Recovery will actually recover fully cases where multiple workspaces were passed as a list to an algorithm (Fixes a known bug with GroupWorkspaces as well)
- Project Recovery will now run normally when you select no or the recovery fails when recovering from a ungraceful exit.
- When autosaving or saving a recovery checkpoint with the Instrument View open the results log would be filled with excess logging and no longer does this.

MantidPlot
----------

Changes
#######

- All File Browser dialog boxes will now (by default) display all valid file extensions as the first file filter.

BugFixes
########

- Fixed issue where an open set of data from ITableWorkspace wouldn't update if the data was changed via python
- Fixed an issue where MantidPlot would crash when renaming workspaces.
