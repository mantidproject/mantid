Abins now delegates parsing of CASTEP .phonon files to the Euphonic library. This gives more robust handling of data files containing Gamma-points with LO-TO splitting; the legacy parser skips past other q-points to find these points, leading to an unpredictable loss of information. Whereas the previous parser favours points with LO-TO splitting, this implementation instead favours non-split points where available; these should give better statistics. [Note that very problematic .phonon files which were losing data away from Gamma are rare; typically CASTEP will include the Gamma points at the top, as assumed by the current behaviour.]
