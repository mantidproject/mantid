Improvements
############

Powder Diffraction
------------------

- The create_total_scattering_pdf merging banks now matches spectra to the spectrum with the largest x range.
- The create_total_scattering_pdf merging banks no longer matches spectra with scale, it now only matches with offset.
- :ref:`HRPDSlabCanAbsorption <algm-HRPDSlabCanAbsorption-v1>` now accepts any thickness parameter and not those in a specified list.

Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------

Single Crystal Diffraction
--------------------------

- :ref:`PredictFractionalPeaks <algm-PredictFractionalPeaks-v1>` now accepts the same set of modulation vector properties as :ref:`IndexPeaks <algm-IndexPeaks-v1>`.

BugFixes
########

Powder Diffraction
------------------

- A bug has been fixed that prevented unicode strings being given as a lim file directory in polaris create_total_scattering_pdf merging banks.

Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------

Single Crystal Diffraction
--------------------------

- Support added for DEMAND (HB3A) to the algorithms :ref:`ConvertWANDSCDtoQ <algm-ConvertWANDSCDtoQ-v1>` and :ref:`FindPeaksMD <algm-FindPeaksMD-v1>` in order to handle additional goniometers.
