Muon Analysis 2 and Frequency Domain Interfaces
---------------------------------------------------
- The plotting window within the Muon Analysis 2 and Frequency Domain Interfaces has been converted into a dockable window,
  which can be docked and undocked at will. This change should improve the user experience for those working on laptops.

Bug Fixes
#########

- The elemental analysis GUI can now handle legacy data which is missing a response dataset, e.g Delayed.
- Fixed a bug with constraints in the Muon Analysis 2 GUI which would cause Mantid to crash.
