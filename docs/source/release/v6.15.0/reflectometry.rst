New Features
------------
- (`#40523 <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/40523>`_) The ISIS Reflectometry GUI will now apply angle-title specific settings from the lookup table on Experiment Settings tab when processing live data. Previously it was necessary to ensure a wildcard row was present in table that would be applied uniformly to all live data.

Bugfixes
--------

:ref:`Release 6.15.0 <v6.15.0>`
