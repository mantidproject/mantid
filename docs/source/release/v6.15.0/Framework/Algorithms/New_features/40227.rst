- New algorithm, :ref:`CreateGroupingByComponent <algm-CreateGroupingByComponent>`, allows for creation of ``GroupingWorkspaces`` where the groups are formed by combining components, under a given parent component. Components which should be combined are identified by providing strings which their names should/should not contain. Each of these groups can be optionally subdivided into a further, ``GroupSubdivision``, number of groups.
