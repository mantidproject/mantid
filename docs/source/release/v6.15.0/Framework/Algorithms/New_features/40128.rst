- :ref:`CreateDetectorTable <algm-CreateDetectorTable>` now supports option ``PickOneDetectorID`` for returning column of detector IDs as a column of integers containing only one detector ID per row.
  By default this option is disabled, so by default the column of detector IDs will consist of strings of one or more detector ID per row.
  This new option was introduced to be used in the background of the new instrument view interface, but might also be useful if the user wants a single detector ID per row.
