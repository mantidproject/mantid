- Improved Abins/Abins2D resolution function for ILL-LAGRANGE
  instrument. A minimum resolution of 0.4 meV is applied at low energy
  transfer for the Cu(220) monochromator: the switch between this
  constant resolution and the energy-dependent resolution was
  previously implemented too low in energy transfer, giving
  unreasonably sharp peaks below 30meV.
