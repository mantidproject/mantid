Algorithms
----------

New
###

- Added algorithm :ref:`algm-CreateFloodWorkspace` which makes a workspace for subsequent flood corrections.
- Added algorithm :ref:`algm-ApplyFloodWorkspace` which applies flood corrections to a workspace.
- :ref:`FindReflectometryLines <algm-FindReflectometryLines-v2>` has been rewritten and updated to version 2. The new version finds a single line by a Gaussian fit. Version 1 has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- Added algorithm :ref:`algm-ReflectometrySliceEventWorkspace` which slices an input event workspace into multiple slices, producing a histogram workspace suitable for use with :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto`.
- :ref:`algm-SaveReflectometryAscii` is a general algorithm which saves the first spectrum of a workspace in Ascii format particularly suited for reflectometry data.
- Some computations from :ref:`algm-ReflectometryMomentumTransfer` were extracted to a new algorithm, :ref:`algm-ReflectometryBeamStatistics`.
- :ref:`algm-GroupToXResolution` can be used to group the reflectivity data (as point data) to the :math:`Q_z` resolution.
- Added algorithm :ref:`algm-ReflectometryBackgroundSubtraction` which calculates the background of a given workspace and removes it.
- Added algorithm :ref:`algm-ReflectometryISISLoadAndProcess` which performs full preparation and processing for a single run or combined set of runs in an ISIS reflectometry reduction.

Improvements
############

- The ILL reduction workflow algorithms were reorganized to allow correct reflectivity calculation in the :literal:`SumInLambda` case.
- Added flood corrections to :ref:`ReflectometryReductionOneAuto <algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto-v2>`. The correction data can be provided either via a flood workspace passed as a property or taken from the parameter file.
- The four Ascii save algorithms ``SaveANSTOAscii``, ``SaveILLCosmosAscii``, ``SaveReflCustomAscii``, and ``SaveReflThreeColumnAscii`` now correctly save x-error and can treat correctly point data and histograms. They are, however, deprecated in favour of :ref:`algm-SaveReflectometryAscii`. Please see :ref:`algm-SaveReflectometryAscii` for more documentation.
- :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto` now supports the Wildes method for polarization corrections as well as Fredrikze when configured in the parameters file.
- :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto` now crops the unbinned output workspace in Q to ``MomentumTransferMin`` and ``MomentumTransferMax``, if specified
- :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOne`, :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto`, :ref:`algm-CreateTransmissionWorkspace`, and :ref:`algm-CreateTransmissionWorkspaceAuto` now use spectrum numbers for their processing instructions instead of workspace indices.
- :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOne` and :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto` now take a parameter to pass processing instructions to the transmission workspace algorithms and no longer accept strict spectrum checking.
- Common naming of slit component name and size properties across algorithms.
- :ref:`algm-SpecularReflectionPositionCorrect` is now compatible with the reflectometers at ILL.
- :ref:`algm-CreateTransmissionWorkspace` and :ref:`algm-CreateTransmissionWorkspaceAuto` now use NormalizeByIntegratedMontitors instead of using MonitorIntegrationWavelengthMin and MonitorIntegrationWavelengthMax being defined, to determine how to normalize.
- ILL reflectometry algorithms name changes: *LinePosition* replaces *BeamCentre*, *DirectLineWorkspace* replaces *DirectBeamWorkspace*, and *TwoTheta* is the preferred input property which replaces *BraggAngle*.
- :ref:`algm-ReflectometryILLPreprocess` does not accept and will not output an `OutputBeamPositionWorkspace`. The peak position and two theta scattering anlge are now present in the SampleLog information as documented.
- ILL's D17 and Figaro instrument definition files are modified to let the detector ID's begin with index 0 instead of 1.
- :ref:`algm-LoadILLReflectometry` lets spectrum numbers start with 0 instead of 1.

Bug fixes
#########

- Fixed the error propagation in :math:`Q` grouping in :ref:`ReflectometryILLConvertToQ <algm-ReflectometryILLConvertToQ>`.
- Handling of group workspaces containing single workspaces when scaling by period and using :literal:`ScaleFactorFromPeriod`, i.e. :literal:`UseManualScaleFactors` is true, :literal:`ManualScaleFactors` remains empty.
- A bug has been fixed on the Settings tab where the IncludePartialBins check box had been hidden by a misplaced text entry box.
- :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto` No longer sums all of a transmission run's workspaces and instead will use the first run only
- In :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto` an issue where if you gave only one of either MomentumTransferMax or MomentumTransferMin were specified it would be ignored, this has been fixed.
- Reverted property names for polarization correction coefficients in :ref:`ReflectometryReductionOneAuto <algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto-v2>` for backwards compatibility.
- Fixed the ``BeamCenter`` property of :ref:`ReflectometrySumInQ <algm-ReflectometrySumInQ>` to actually be a fractional workspace index.

Liquids Reflectometer
---------------------

- Default x-direction pixel range for the scaling factor calculation is now set to the full width of the detector as opposed to a restricted guess.

Magnetism Reflectometer
-----------------------

- Added option to overwrite :literal:`DIRPIX` and :literal:`DANGLE0`.
- Added option to skip the final rebinning.

ISIS Reflectometry Interface
----------------------------

This is the last release of Mantid which will include the old reflectometry interface. It will be removed in version 4.1.

New
###

- Flood correction options have been added to the interface.

Improvements
############

- The interface now supports the Wildes method for polarization corrections as well as Fredrikze when configured in the parameters file.

Bug fixes
#########

- The SaveASCII tab from the interface was unable to save in some places on Windows and that has now been fixed.

:ref:`Release 4.0.0 <v4.0.0>`
