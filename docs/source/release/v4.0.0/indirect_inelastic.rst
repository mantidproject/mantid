Algorithms
----------

New Algorithms
##############

- :ref:`BASISCrystalDiffraction <algm-BASISCrystalDiffraction>` replaces :ref:`BASISDiffraction <algm-BASISDiffraction>`, now deprecated.
- :ref:`BASISPowderDiffraction <algm-BASISPowderDiffraction>` obtains scattered elastic intensity versus momentum transfer and versus scattering angle.
- TOF correction for neutrons incorrectly interpreted as slow neutrons in :ref:`BASISPowderDiffraction <algm-BASISPowderDiffraction>`
- Deprecated algorithm BASISReduction311 has been removed.
- :ref:`LoadEMU <algm-LoadEMU>` loader for an ANSTO EMU backscattering event file.
- :ref:`IndirectReplaceFitResult <algm-IndirectReplaceFitResult>` will replace the *_Result* fit data found in one workspace with the 
  single fit data provided within a second workspace.

Improvements
############

- :ref:`BASISReduction <algm-BASISReduction>` user interface contains slightly different naming convention for selection of reflection and works for old and new DAS.


:ref:`Release 4.0.0 <v4.0.0>`

Data Analysis Interface
-----------------------

New Features
############

- IqtFit and ConvFit have a new option to edit the *_Results* workspace. This option allows the selection of two *_Result* 
  workspaces (one containing the results of a sequential fit for multiple spectra (1), and the other containing the results of a fit 
  for a single spectrum(2)). The algorithm :ref:`IndirectReplaceFitResult <algm-IndirectReplaceFitResult>` will replace the 
  relevant data found in workspace (1) with the data found in workspace (2).

Improvements
############

- The Run button is now above the output options, and is disabled during fitting along with the output buttons.
- The Run button in the Data Analysis tabs is now above the output options, and is disabled during fitting.
- The Fit Single Spectrum buttons in the Data Analysis tabs MSDFit, ConvFit, I(Q,t)Fit and F(Q)Fit are now disabled
  during fitting.
- When the InelasticDiffSphere, InelasticDiffRotDiscreteCircle, ElasticDiffSphere or ElasticDiffRotDiscreteCircle
  Fit Types are selected in the ConvFit Tab, the Q values are retrieved from the workspaces, preventing a crash
  when plotting a guess.
- The Plot buttons in MSDFit, I(Q,t)Fit, ConvFit and F(Q)Fit are disabled after a Run when the result workspace only
  has one data point to plot.
- There is now an option to choose which output parameter to plot in MSDFit.
- An option to skip the calculation of Monte Carlo Errors on the I(Q,t) Tab has been added.
- During the calculation of Monte Carlo Errors, a progress bar is now shown.
- In the I(Q,t) Tab, it is now possible to select which spectrum you want to plot for Plot Spectrum.
- In the I(Q,t) Tab, it is now possible to select a range of spectra for a Tiled Plot. The interface allows a
  maximum of 18 plots.
- The WorkspaceIndex and Q value in the FitPropertyBrowser are now updated when the Plot Spectrum number is changed.
  This improvement can be seen in ConvFit when functions which depend on Q value are selected.
- Fit and Fit Sequential in the Fit combobox above the FitPropertyBrowser are now disabled while fitting is taking place.
- The option to choose which workspace index to Plot Spectrum for and from which output workspace is now given in Elwin.
- ConvFit now allows the loading of Dave ASCII files which end with '_sqw.dave'.
- The results of a fit in MSDFit, IqtFit, ConvFit and F(Q)Fit are now plotted with error bars.
- The AddWorkspace windows (opened from the Multiple Input tab) now stay open after adding a workspace to the data table. This 
  is found on the MSDFit, I(Q,t)Fit, ConvFit and F(Q)Fit interfaces.
- It is now possible to load a Nexus file without it's history on the Elwin interface by unchecking the Load History checkbox.
- It is now possible to undock the mini-plots on the MSDFit, IqtFit, ConvFit and F(Q)Fit interfaces.


Bugfixes
########

- The workspace(s) loaded into F(Q) Fit are checked for EISF or Width values, and an error message is displayed
  if neither are present. This prevents an unexpected crash.
- The parameter values for a selected spectrum are now updated properly when a Fit is run using the Fit String
  option in ConvFit.
- An unexpected crash is prevented when Plot Current Preview is clicked when no data is loaded. A meaningful error
  message is now displayed.
- The Probability Density Functions (PDF) workspaces for the FABADA minimiser in ConvFit no longer overwrite each other.
  Various other improvements in the display of the FABADA PDF's have also been finished.
- Loading a resolution file before a reduced file in ConvFit no longer causes an unexpected error.
- A bug where fixed parameters don't remain fixed when using the FABADA minimizer in ConvFit has been corrected.
- The expression for the Fit type Yi in MSDFit was incorrect and has now been corrected.
- The x-axis labels in the output plots for MSDFit are now correct.
- An unexpected error is now prevented when clicking Plot Guess from the Display combo box in ConvFit without first loading
  a reduced file.
- The output workspace ending with _Results now contains workspaces with corrected names which detail the fit functions used.
- Selecting multiple data using the All Spectra checkbox without first selected a sample file used to cause an unexpected error.
  This is now prevented. Meaningful error messages are also displayed when a sample or resolution file are not selected.
- In the Elwin interface, the errors are now propagated correctly through to the workspace with extension _elt.
- The :ref:`HallRoss <func-Hall-Ross>` fit function was updated to have :math:`\hbar` in its formula. The 
  :ref:`TeixeiraWater <func-TeixeiraWater>` and :ref:`ChudleyElliot <func-ChudleyElliot>` fit functions 
  now have a functionDeriv1D method.
- A bug causing the output *_Results* workspace from a single fit to have an incorrect name has been fixed.


Data Corrections Interface
--------------------------

Improvements
############

- Added 'Interpolation' combobox to Calculate Monte Carlo Absorption. This allows the method of interpolation
  to be selected. Allowed values: ['Linear', 'CSpline'].
- Added 'MaxScatterPtAttempts' spinbox to Calculate Monte Carlo Absorption. This sets the maximum number of
  tries to be made to generate a scattering point.
- In the Calculate Monte Carlo Absorption Tab, all of the options in the Monte Carlo section are now read from
  an instrument parameter files once a file has been loaded.
- The option to choose which spectrum to Plot Spectrum for is now available in the ContainerSubtraction Tab and
  ApplyAbsorptionCorrections Tab.


Data Reduction Interface
------------------------

Improvements
############

- Added 'Default' detector grouping option in ISISEnergyTransfer for TOSCA, to allow a default grouping
  using the grouping specified in the Instrument Parameter File.
- ISISEnergyTransfer now allows overlapping detector grouping.
- The Run button has been moved to be above the output options. The run button, save button and plotting options
  are now disabled while a tab is running or plotting.
- It is now possible to choose which spectrum to Plot Output for in the S(Q,w) Tab.

Bugfixes
########
- A bug where the output reduced files had large file sizes depending on the size of the batch being reduced from 
  the :ref:`ISISIndirectEnergyTransfer <algm-ISISIndirectEnergyTransfer>` algorithm on the ISISEnergyTransfer interface has been 
  fixed. The :ref:`ISISIndirectEnergyTransferWrapper <algm-ISISIndirectEnergyTransferWrapper>` algorithm should be used instead
  in order to avoid these large file sizes.
- A bug where using a cropped calibration file (from a previous run) on the ISISEnergyTransfer interface would cause an 
  error has been fixed.
- A bug where specifying a custom detector grouping for OSIRIS was not working has been fixed.
- A bug caused by incorrect masked detectors during a reduction of an individual runs has been fixed. This could sometimes cause 
  unexpected peaks in the output plots.
- A crash caused by data being loaded multiple times on the transmission tab has been fixed, as part of this fix the preview now shows a
  preview of the plot on run being clicked and not before as this was the cause of the issue.

  :alt: The individual runs TOSCA bug before and after being fixed.

- A bug caused by incorrect masked detectors during a reduction for a summed run has been fixed. This would cause the summed runs 
  intensity to be higher than that of the individual runs with the same run numbers.
