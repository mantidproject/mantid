The identification of isotopes has been improved in Abins/Abins2D.

- Previously, a species would only be identified as the standard
  isotopic mixture if the mass is very close to the Mantid reference
  data. In some cases the values used by external phonon calculators
  are significantly different and this could lead to misassignment.
  (e.g. Zn in CASTEP.) Now, Abins will initially choose the _nearest_
  mass option between an isotope and the standard isotopic mixture.

- Many isotopes lack cross-section data and would lead to NaN
  intensities. Now, if a NaN cross-section is identified Abins
  will either use the standard mixture data (if the mass is within
  0.01) or raise an error.
