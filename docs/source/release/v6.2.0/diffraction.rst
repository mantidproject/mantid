    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

Powder Diffraction
------------------
New features
############

Improvements
############
- :ref:`SCDCalibratePanels <algm-SCDCalibratePanels-v2>` major interface update along with enabling the calibration of T0 and sample position.
- :ref:`SCDCalibratePanels <algm-SCDCalibratePanels-v2>` minor interface update that allows fine control of bank rotation calibration.
- :ref:`SNAPReduce <algm-SNAPReduce-v1>` permits saving selected property names and values to file, to aid autoreduction.
- improve performance of :ref:`ApplyDiffCal <algm-ApplyDiffCal>` on large instruments eg WISH. This in turn improves the performance of :ref:`AlignAndFocusPowder <algm-AlignAndFocusPowder>`

Bugfixes
########
- fix d-spacing calculation when parabolic model is selected.

Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------
New features
############

Improvements
############

Bugfixes
########
- The help button on the Engineering Diffraction interface points to the correct page, having been broken in the last release

Improvements
############
- The workflows for Calibration and Focusing in the EnggDiffraction GUI and EnginX scripts have been replaced to make use of faster, better tested C++ algorithms (PDCalibration) - as a result the following algorithms have been deprecated, and will likely be removed entirely in the next release: EnggCalibrate, EnggCalibrateFull, EnggFocus, EnggVanadiumCorrections.

Bugfixes
########
- Sequential fitting in the EngDiff UI now uses the output of the last successful fit (as opposed to the previous fit) as the initial parameters for the next fit.


Single Crystal Diffraction
--------------------------
New features
############
- New algorithm :ref:`HB3AIntegrateDetectorPeaks <algm-HB3AIntegrateDetectorPeaks>` for integrating four-circle data from HB3A in detector space.
- New algorithm :ref:`ApplyInstrumentToPeaks <algm-ApplyInstrumentToPeaks>` to update the instrument of peaks within a PeaksWorkspace.
- New plotting script that provides diagnostic plots of SCDCalibratePanels output.

Improvements
############
- Find detector in peaks will check which det is closer when dealing with peak-in-gap situation for tube-type detectors.
- Existing :ref:`SCDCalibratePanels <algm-SCDCalibratePanels-v2>` now provides better calibration of panel orientation for flat panel detectors.
- Existing :ref:`MaskPeaksWorkspace <algm-MaskPeaksWorkspace-v1>` now also supports tube-type detectors used at the CORELLI instrument.
- Existing :ref:`SCDCalibratePanels <algm-SCDCalibratePanels-v2>` now retains the value of small optimization results instead of zeroing them.

Bugfixes
########
- Expand the Q space search radius in DetectorSearcher to avoid missing peaks when using :ref:`PredictPeaks <algm-PredictPeaks>`.

:ref:`Release 6.2.0 <v6.2.0>`
