Frequency Domain Analysis
-------------------------

New Features
############

- The Frequency Domain Analysis interface now allows you to perform a sequential fit using the Sequential Fitting tab.
- The Sequential Fitting tab allows you to choose the type of dataset you want to fit.

Bug Fixes
#########

- In frequency domain analysis the phasetables calculated from :ref:`MuonMaxent <algm-MuonMaxent>` can be used for
  :ref:`PhaseQuad <algm-PhaseQuad>` calculations on the phase tab.

Muon Analysis 2
---------------

New Features
############

- The Model Fitting tab allows you to perform fits across the sample logs and fit parameters stored in your results table.
- Users can now copy sequential fitting parameters to all other runs. To do this, click the checkbox to turn this feature
  on and change a parmeter. The change should be copied to the other cells in the same column. Turn the feature off to make
  changes to single rows.

Improvements
############

- When running the Dynamic Kubo Toyabe fit function you should now be able to see the BinWidth to 3 decimal places.

Bug Fixes
#########
- A bug has been fixed in the BinWidth for the Dynamic Kobu Toyabe Fitting Function which caused a crash and did not provide
  any information about why the value was invalid. Will now revert to last viable BinWidth used and explain why.
- The autoscale option when `All` is selected will now show the largest and smallest y value from the all of the plots.

Muon Analysis 2 and Frequency Domain Analysis
---------------------------------------------

New Features
############

- It is now possible to Exclude a range from a fit range when doing a fit on the Fitting tab.
- Added a 'Covariance Matrix' button to the Fitting tab that can be used to open and inspect the normalised covariance parameters of a fit.
- Can now plot the raw count data in the GUI.

Improvements
############

- It is now possible to do a vertical resize of the plot in Muon Analysis and Frequency Domain Analysis.
- The plotting has been updated for better stability.
- The plotting now has autoscale active by default.
- It is now possible to load nexusV2 files in the GUI.
- Added a table to store phasequads in the phase tab, phasequads also no longer automatically delete themselves
  when new data is loaded
- Frequency domain analysis can now use groups in :ref:`MuonMaxent <algm-MuonMaxent>` calculations.
- The labels on the tabs in the GUIs will now show in full



Bug Fixes
#########
- The GUIs will no longer crash if there are any whitespaces in the run range (e.g. 6010- 3).
- The GUIs can also now cope with a range of runs that span between two different decades where the second number
  in the range is smaller than the final digit of the first number in the range (e.g. 6018-3 will give 6018-6023 now).


ALC
---

New Features
############

- Added an external plot button to the ALC interface which will plot in workbench the current tab's plot
- Added a period info button to the ALC interface which displays a table of period information from the loaded runs
  (this is equivalent to the periods button in the Muon Analysis and Frequency Domain Analysis Interfaces)
- If the sample log has a unit, it will be displayed on the axis of the plot
- The plots are no longer normalised by bin width

Elemental Analysis
------------------

Improvements
############
- Updated :ref:`LoadElementalAnalysisData <algm-LoadElementalAnalysisData>` algorithm to include Poisson errors for the counts data.

Algorithms
----------

Improvements
############
- Updated :ref:`LoadMuonLog <algm-LoadMuonLog>` to read units for most log values.
- :ref:`LoadMuonNexus <algm-LoadMuonNexus>`, :ref:`LoadMuonNexusV2 <algm-LoadMuonNexusV2>` and :ref:`LoadPSIMuonBin <algm-LoadPSIMuonBin>`
  have all been updated to return the same outputs. Check their documentation pages for more.
- It is now possible to exclude a fit range when executing the :ref:`CalculateMuonAsymmetry <algm-CalculateMuonAsymmetry>` algorithm.
- The :ref:`PlotAsymmetryByLogValue <algm-PlotAsymmetryByLogValue>` algorithm will include the units for the log value (when they are available)

BugFixes
############
- Fixed bug in :ref:`FitGaussianPeaks <algm-FitGaussianPeaks>` algorithm in which a peak at the end of range would cause an error due to not enough data point being available to fit parameters.

:ref:`Release 6.2.0 <v6.2.0>`
