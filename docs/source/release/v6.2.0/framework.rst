Concepts
--------

Algorithms
----------
- All remote algorithms have been deprecated as they have not been used since v3.8.

Improvements
############

- :ref:`CreateSampleWorkspace <algm-CreateSampleWorkspace>` has new property InstrumentName.

Bugfixes
########

- Fix rare divide-by zero error when running :ref:`GetEi <algm-GetEi>` on noisy data.


Improvements
############

- :ref:`CrossCorrelate <algm-CrossCorrelate>` has additional parameter to set the maximum d-space shift during cross correlation

Improvements
############

- :ref:`CrossCorrelate <algm-CrossCorrelate>` has additional parameter to set the maximum d-space shift during cross correlation

Fit Functions
-------------
- new method `IPeakFunction::intensityError` calculates the error in the integrated intensity of the peak due to uncertainties in the values of the fit parameters.


Data Objects
------------
- **Sample shapes which are CSGObjects can now be plotted. Shapes can also be merged, such as a sphere with a cylindrical hole. For more details see** :ref:`Mesh_Plots`.

Python
------

Bugfixes
########

- Added parser for input Names to :ref:`algm-CreateMDHistoWorkspace` to allow inputs such as `Names='[H,0,0],[0,K,0],[0,0,L]'`.
- Fixed bug in :ref:`algm-ConvertToMDMinMaxLocal` where wrong min max calculated if the workspace includes monitor spectra or spectra without any detectors
- Fix bug in :ref:`CalculateMultipleScattering <algm-CalculateMultipleScattering>` where detector position was incorrectly determined on a workspace where the workspace index didn't match the detector
  index eg if the workspace was loaded with SpectrumMin specified to exclude some monitors
