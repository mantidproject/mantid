Direct Geometry
---------------

New Algorithms
##############

- :ref:`ApplyDetailedBalanceMD <algm-ApplyDetailedBalanceMD>` to apply detailed balance to MDEvents
- :ref:`DgsScatteredTransmissionCorrectionMD <algm-DgsScatteredTransmissionCorrectionMD>` weights the intensity of each detected event according to its final energy.

.. warning:: **Developers:** Sort changes under appropriate heading
    putting new features at the top of the section, followed by
    improvements, followed by bug fixes.


CrystalField
------------

Improvements
############
- Added documentation and warning messages in the :ref:`Crystal Field Python Interface` related to IntensityScaling
- :ref:`LoadILLTOF <algm-LoadILLTOF>` now adds input run number also to a metadata field `run_list`, indended to contain a full list of numors, handled by :ref:`MergeRuns <algm-MergeRuns>`
- The order of detector efficiency correction and rebinning in :ref:`algm-DirectILLReduction` has been inversed

BugFixes
########
- A bug has been fixed in the plot methods for CrystalField and CrystalFieldMultiSite
- Fixed a bug in the :ref:`Crystal Field Python Interface` which prevented the application of IntensityScaling factors
- Peaks are (re)set upon rebuilding the single spectrum function as a multi-spectrum function
  due to the physical properties. This re-setting peaks is needed to maintain the intended ties.
- A bug has been fixed in :ref:`ConvertToMD <algm-ConvertToMD>` that sometimes crashes Mantid when files are summed together.
- A bug has been fixed in PyChop that caused crashes when no Ei was specified.


MSlice
------

Improvements
############
- Added tests for script generation functions
- Added new tab with plots manager to MSlice GUI
- Enable powder (Bragg) peaks on cut plots

BugFixes
########
- Fixed an issue that caused overplot info on slice plots to get lost after replotting

:ref:`Release 6.2.0 <v6.2.0>`
