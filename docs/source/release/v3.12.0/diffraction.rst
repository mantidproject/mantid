    putting new features at the top of the section, followed by
    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

Powder Diffraction
------------------
- :ref:`SaveFocusedXYE <algm-SaveFocusedXYE>` has been amended to write the metadata (e.g. temperature) value in the header, in the form of the Fullprof readable keyword.

- Some new functionality for POLARIS in the ISIS Powder scripts. Adjusted some default parameters and output unsplined vanadium workspace by default
- ISIS_Powder scripts for PEARL now support creation of grouping .cal files from ceria run(s)
- 'suffix' parameter added for output filenames from all ISIS_Powder instruments
- The ``CalibrationFile`` is now optional in :ref:`SNSPowderReduction <algm-SNSPowderReduction>`. In this case time focussing will use :ref:`ConvertUnits <algm-ConvertUnits>` and the instrument geometry. Care must be taken to supply a ``GroupingFile`` otherwise all of the spectra will be kept separate.
- :ref:`SaveGSS <algm-SaveGSS>` is relaxed to accept non-TOF point data workspaces as well.
- New algorithm :ref:`algm-EstimateDivergence` estimates the beam divergence due to finite slit size
- :ref:`PDCalibration <algm-PDCalibration>` returns three more diagnostic workspaces: one for the fitted peak heights, one for the fitted peak widths, and one for observed resolution.
- :ref:`LoadILLDiffraction <algm-LoadILLDiffraction>` now supports D2B files with calibrated data.
- New algorithm :ref:`algm-SumOverlappingTubes` combines a detector scan for D2B into a single workspace.
- ISIS Powder scripts for HRPD now support extra TOF windows 10-50 and 180-280
- After calling create_vanadium and focus in ISIS Powder scripts on POLARIS, the output workspaces always contain the sample material if it is set using set_sample_material. (To view the sample material, right click the workspace and click 'Sample Material...')


Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------

- :ref:`GSASIIRefineFitPeaks <algm-GSASIIRefineFitPeaks>` has been re-integrated with the
  latest version of GSAS-II, allowing Rietveld and Pawley refinement
  within Mantid.
- Usability improvements in the GUI:
  + The "Invalid RB number" popup window in the GUI has been replaced with a more user-friendly message
  + Improved progress reporting for Calibration and Focus
  + Enabled multi-run fitting and plotting in the Fitting tab
     
Single Crystal Diffraction
--------------------------
- :ref:`FilterPeaks <algm-FilterPeaks>` now supports filtering peaks by TOF, d-spacing, and wavelength.

- HB3A reduction interface has been enhanced.  A child window is added to it for users to pre-process scans and save the processed and merged data to NeXus files in order to save time when they start to reduce and visualize the data. A record file is generated along with processed scans to record the calibration information. During data reduction, scans that have been processed in pre-processing will be loaded automatically from corresponding MD files.

- In HB3A reduction intervace, section for downloading experimental data via http server has been removed from main UI.

- :ref:`IntegratePeaksMDHKL <algm-IntegratePeaksMDHKL>` now has option to specify background shell instead of using default background determination.

- :ref:`FindUBUsingFFT <algm-FindUBUsingFFT>` now has options to specify number of iterations to refine UB and also resolution of the search through possible orientations.  Minimum angle between a,b,c vectors reduced for large unit cells.

- :ref:`FindUBUsingLatticeParameters <algm-FindUBUsingLatticeParameters>` now has option to specify number of iterations to refine UB. 


Imaging
-------

Features Removed
----------------

* The "Test the Curve Fit widget" graphical interface has been removed, it was a test harness for developers and was not intended to be exposed during earlier releases.


:ref:`Release 3.12.0 <v3.12.0>`
