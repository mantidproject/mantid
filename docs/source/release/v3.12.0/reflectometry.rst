- The new algorithm :ref:`algm-LoadILLPolarizationFactors` can load the polarization efficiency files used on D17 at ILL.
- The *BraggAngle* property of :ref:`algm-LoadILLReflectometry` now works as expected: the detector will be rotated such that the reflected peak will be at twice *BraggAngle*.

:ref:`Release 3.12.0 <v3.12.0>`
