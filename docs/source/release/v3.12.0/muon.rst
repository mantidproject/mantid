Interface
---------

Improvements
############

- Added a cancel button to the MaxEnt widget in Frequency Domain Analysis.
- Added checkboxes for "add all pairs" and "add all groups" to the settings tab.
- The data plot style in the settings tab of Muon Analysis, only alters the plot range. It no longer crops the data.
- Results table in Muon Analysis now sets relevant columns to numeric.
- The period display no longer becomes blank when changing the period selection in multiple fitting mode.
- The group/pair selection in Muon Analysis no longer resets when changing tabs or loading data.
- The Frequency Domain Analysis GUI now uses :ref:`CalMuonDetectorPhases <algm-CalMuonDetectorPhases>` to create the phase table for PhaseQuad FFTs.
- The Frequency Domain Analysis GUI now uses :ref:`MuonMaxent <algm-MuonMaxent>` to calculate the frequency spectrum in MaxEnt mode.
- The ALC interface now allows background sections with negative values.
- If data is loaded with 0 good frames into Muon Analysis then it will try to load the data without dead time correction (does not need number of good frames).
- Muon analysis no longer disables the "co add" and "simultaneous" buttons in the multiple fitting interface.
- Frequency domain analysis will reload the data if the active workspace has changed.
- Muon analysis no longer crashes when using the browse button in sequential fitting.
- The period summation/subtraction can now be used in multiple fitting.
- Muon analysis now handles the "auto background" gracefully in single and multiple fitting modes.
- We have disabled some non functional graph right click context menu items or adding functions when in multi data fitting mode, in the Data Analysis tab of the Muon Analysis Interface.
- Frequency domain analysis will produce a warning if there is no data to load.

Bug fixes
#########

- Log values are no longer filtered by start time when loaded into muon analysis.
- Different options under `Settings`>`Data Binning` give different options for input (OSX bug, see Issue ##22167). Fixed in patch.

Algorithms
----------

New
###

- :ref:`MuonMaxent <algm-MuonMaxent>` calculates a single frequency spectrum from multiple time domain spectra.

Improvements
############

- :ref:`MuonProcess <algm-MuonProcess>` now has a flag to determine if to crop the input workspace (default is true). In the Muon Analysis interface this flag has been set to false.
-  :ref:`EstimateMuonAsymmetryFromCounts <algm-EstimateMuonAsymmetryFromCounts-v1>`: if the number of good frames is zero, then a value of 1 is assumed for the number of good frames.

Bug fixes
#########

- :ref:`CalMuonDetectorPhases <algm-CalMuonDetectorPhases>` has had the sign of the phase shift changed, this produces data with a positive frequency spike as expected.

:ref:`Release 3.12.0 <v3.12.0>`
