    improvements, followed by bug fixes.


Interfaces
----------
- Added a cancel button to the MaxEnt widget in Frequency Domain Analysis.

Bug Fixes
---------
-:ref:`CalMuonDetectorPhases <algm-CalMuonDetectorPhases>` has had the sign of the phase shift changed, this produces data with a positive frequency spike as expected.

Interface
---------
- The data plot style in the settings tab of Muon Analysis, only alters the plot range. It no longer crops the data.  
- Results table in Muon Analysis now sets relevant columns to numeric. 
- The Frequency Domain Analysis GUI now uses :ref:`CalMuonDetectorPhases <algm-CalMuonDetectorPhases>` to create the phase table for PhaseQuad FFTs. 

Algorithms
----------
-:ref:`MuonProcess <algm-MuonProcess>` now has a flag to determine if to crop the input workspace (default is true). In the Muon Analysis interface this flag has been set to false.

:ref:`Release 3.12.0 <v3.12.0>`
