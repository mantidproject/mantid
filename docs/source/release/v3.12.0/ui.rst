Installation
------------

Workbench
---------

- Fixed a bug where MantidPlot would crash if the sample log fields used for run start and end contained non-ISO8601 conforming values.
- Fixed an issue where updating a workspace changes the number format from decimal to scientific notation if the workspace is being viewed.


SliceViewer and Vates Simple Interface
--------------------------------------

- Update SwitchToSliceViewer (shift + click) in MultiSlice view to work with nonorthogonal axes.
- Pressing alt while clicking an arrow in the MultiSlice view opens a text box where one may precisely enter the slice position.
- Fixed bug which would cause slice viewer to crash when deleting an overlaid peaks workspace.
- Fixed a bug where overwriting peaks workspaces with overlaid in the slice viewer with peak backgrounds shown cause Mantid to crash.

MultiDataset Fitting Interface
------------------------------

- After a simultaneous fit the parameters are saved in a TableWorkspace made to simplify plotting their values against the datasets.
  The parameters are organised into columns and each row corresponds to a dataset.
