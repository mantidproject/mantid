- Fixed a bug in :ref:`ISIS POLARIS powder reduction<isis-powder-diffraction-polaris-ref>` such that subsequent calls to ``focus`` method used parameters provided in previous ``focus`` calls that were cached incorrectly as ``_RunDetails`` objects in ``Polaris`` object and attched as attributes in ``InstrumentSettings`` object.
- A new parameter named ``delete_old_kwargs`` defaulted to ``False`` was introduced to ``InstrumentSettings.update_attributes`` such that whenever it is called with ``kwargs`` and ``delete_old_kwargs=True``, it will make sure any attributes falls into the set difference between the old kwargs and the new kwargs that are not privided via config file are deleted from ``InstrumentSettings`` object to avoid them act as gost attributes for subsequent usages.
