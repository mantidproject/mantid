- ``DirectBeamRun`` property of algorithm :ref:`algm-SANSISISPolarizationCorrections` is no longer required to be a group of 4 periods.
- Added ``AssertSpinState`` property to :ref:`algm-SANSISISPolarizationCorrections`, to select if the spin state configuration will be determined and asserted for each transmission run.
- Added ``PxDInitialValue``, ``LifetimeInitialValue`` and ``HePolInitialValue`` input properties to :ref:`algm-SANSISISPolarizationCorrections` to change the initial values for efficiencies fit.
- Added ``DeletePartialWsOnFail`` property to :ref:`algm-SANSISISPolarizationCorrections` to avoid deleting partial workspaces if the algorithm fails.
