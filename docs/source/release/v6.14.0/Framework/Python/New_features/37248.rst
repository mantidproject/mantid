- Makes the large offline documentation an optional rather than a mandatory install, reducing installer/download size
  significantly.

  - Improvements:

    - For users who frequently access online docs or have bandwidth constraints, this saves considerable disk space
      (potentially hundreds of MB).
    - Those who prefer local/offline usage can still opt to install the documentation package and continue working
      without internet access.
    - A clear indicator has been added to the Help Window’s toolbar to show whether Mantid is displaying ``Local Docs``
      or ``Online Docs``.

  - Key benefits:

    - Greater flexibility in how Mantid is set up — you choose whether to save space or have full local, offline docs.
