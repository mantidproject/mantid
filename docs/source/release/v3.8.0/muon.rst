- Choosing *run_start* or *run_end* as the log value will now work correctly - the values are taken as seconds relative to the start time of the first run.

Muon Analysis
#############

Multi-dataset fitting
*********************

The *Data Analysis* tab of the Muon Analysis interface has been updated to enable simultaneous fits of multiple datasets.
A full explanation of how to use this new functionality is contained in the interface's documentation.
Results tables of these new kinds of fit can also be created.

As this is a new change for this release, please report any bugs, or requests for enhancements, to the development team.
If you find a bug that stops you working, or would simply prefer to stick with the previous UI, just check the "Compatibility mode" box on the *Settings* tab and this will revert the interface to how it was in Mantid 3.7.

Other fixes and enhancements:
*****************************

- When reusing the same plot window, an option has been added on the Settings tab to control how many previous fits are kept. It can be adjusted to 0 (remove all previous fits; default pre-Mantid 3.7), 1 (keep just one previous fit plus this one; new default) or higher.

- *run_start* and *run_end* are now available as log values to use in the results table. They can be inserted either as text (ISO-formatted date strings) or as seconds since the start of the first run.

- Documentation has been moved to the Mantid help system.

- A bug was fixed where, when plotting the log of counts and then switching to plot counts or asymmetry, the y axis was left as a logarithmic axis.

Algorithms
----------

- :ref:`MaxEnt <algm-MaxEnt>`: MaxEnt has a new property, *ComplexImage*, which can be set
  to *False* when the imaginary part of the image should not be taken into account for the
  calculations.

- :ref:`MaxEnt <algm-MaxEnt>`: The expression for the second derivative of real (pos/neg) images has been corrected.

- :ref:`MaxEnt <algm-MaxEnt>`: The reconstructed image is always a point data workspace. The reconstructed data is of the same type as the input workspace.

- :ref:`CalMuonDetectorPhases <algm-CalMuonDetectorPhases>`: the *Frequency* parameter is now supplied in MHz rather than megaradians per second.

- :ref:`CalMuonDetectorPhases <algm-CalMuonDetectorPhases>`: The first column of the output phase table now shows spectrum numbers rather than workspace indices.

- :ref:`PlotAsymmetryByLogValue <algm-PlotAsymmetryByLogValue>`: If *run_start* or *run_end* are chosen as the log to use, the values are taken as seconds relative to the start time of the first run.

- :ref:`LoadMuonNexus <algm-LoadMuonNexus>`: Fixed loading of certain v1 NeXus files converted from other formats that did not contain number of good frames.

- :ref:`LoadMuonNexus <algm-LoadMuonNexus>`: Now loads the correct detector IDs, whether the whole file is loaded or just a selection of spectra. Correctly handles muon v2 Nexus files, in which one spectrum can map to multiple detectors.

Fit Functions
-------------

- :ref:`Keren <func-Keren>`: A bug was fixed so that the field comes out in the correct units.
