Improvements
------------

- :ref:`MDNormDirectSC <algm-MDNormDirectSC>` has an option to skip safety checks. This improves the speed when acting on workspace groups.

- A qtiGenie method *export_masks* was brought to Mantid as :ref:`ExportSpectraMask <algm-ExportSpectraMask>` Python algorithm and got documentation, unit tests and Python GUI.
  The algorithm allows to export list of masked workspace spectra and save these spectra as ISIS *.msk* file. 
  The export mask procedure is often used by instrument scientists in ISIS, and they had to initialize qtiGenie to do this operation before these changes. 

- :ref:`GetEiMonDet <algm-GetEiMonDet>` has had a complete rewrite. The new version 2 utilizes elastic peak position data generated by :ref:`FindEPP <algm-FindEPP>`, the detectors of interest are specified by their indices instead of distances from sample, and the revised algorithm is able to deal with cases where neutrons arrive at the detectors in a later time frame.

- There is a new algorithm :ref:`MagFormFactorCorrection <algm-MagFormFactorCorrection` which will scale an input workspace by 1/F(Q) where F(Q) is the magnetic form factor for a specified magnetic ion.

Crystal Field
-------------

- A fitting function was added (:ref:`CrystalFieldMultiSpectrum <func-CrystalFieldMultiSpectrum>`) that fits crystal field parameters to multiple spectra simultaneously.
