HistogramData
-------------

A new module for dealing with histogram data has been added, it is now being used internally in Mantid to store data in various workspace types.

- For C++ users, details can be found in the `transition documentation <http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/concepts/HistogramData.html>`_.
- For Python users, the interface is so far unchanged.
  However, to ensure data consistency and to reduce the risk of bugs, histograms now enforce length limitations. For example, there must be one bin edge more than data (Y and E) values.
  If you experience trouble, in particular exceptions about size mismatch, please refer to the section `Dealing with problems <http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/concepts/HistogramData.html#dealing-with-problems>`_.

Improved
########

- :ref:`FilterEvents <algm-FilterEvents>` now produces output
  workspaces with the same workspace numbers as specified by the
  ``SplittersWorkspace``.

Deprecated

Performance
-----------

- The introduction of the HistogramData module may have influenced the performance of some algorithms and many workflows.
  A moderate number of algorithms should experience a speedup and reduced memory consumption.
  If you experience unusual slowdowns, please contact the developer team.

CurveFitting
------------

- Added two new minimizers belonging to the trust region family of algorithms: DTRS and More-Sorensen.
