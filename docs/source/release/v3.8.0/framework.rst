Framework Changes
=================

.. contents:: Table of Contents
   :local:

- ``Facilities.xml`` was updated for changes to the SNS live data servers.

- A cmake parameter ``ENABLE_MANTIDPLOT`` (default ``True``) was added to facilitate framework only builds.

HistogramData
-------------

A new module for dealing with histogram data has been added, it is now being used internally in Mantid to store data in various workspace types.

- For C++ users, details can be found in the `transition documentation <http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/concepts/HistogramData.html>`_.
- For Python users, the interface is so far unchanged.
  However, to ensure data consistency and to reduce the risk of bugs, histograms now enforce length limitations. For example, there must be one bin edge more than data (Y and E) values.
  If you experience trouble, in particular exceptions about size mismatch, please refer to the section `Dealing with problems <http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/concepts/HistogramData.html#dealing-with-problems>`_.

Concepts
--------

- ``MatrixWorkspace`` : When masking bins or detectors with non-zero weights,
  undefined and infinite values and errors will be zeroed.
- ``Lattice`` : Allow setting a UB matrix with negative determinant (improper rotation)

Algorithms
----------

New
###

-  :ref:`ClearCache <algm-ClearCache>` an algorithm to simplify the clearance of several in memory or disk caches used in Mantid.

- :ref:`LoadPreNexusLive <algm-LoadPreNexusLive>` will load "live"
  data from file on legacy SNS DAS instruments.

- :ref:`CropToComponent <algm-CropToComponent>` allows for cropping a workspace to a list of component names.
- :ref:`CreateUserDefinedBackground <algm-CreateUserDefinedBackground>` takes a set of points
  that the user has chosen and creates a background workspace out of them. It interpolates the
  points so the resulting background can be subtracted from the original data.

- :ref:`SaveDiffFittingAscii <algm-SaveDiffFittingAscii>` an algorithm which saves a TableWorkspace containing
  diffraction fitting results as an ASCII file


Improved
########

- :ref:`FlatPlatePaalmanPingsCorrection <algm-FlatPlatePaalmanPingsCorrection>` & :ref:`CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrection <algm-CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrection>`
  now accept 'Direct' as a possible ``EMode`` parameter.

- :ref:`FilterEvents <algm-FilterEvents>` now produces output
  workspaces with the same workspace numbers as specified by the
  ``SplittersWorkspace``.
- :ref:`ConvertAxisByFormula <algm-ConvertAxisByFormula>` now supports instrument geometry vairables and several constants within the formula.  Axes are now reversed if the need to be to maintain increasing axis values.

- :ref:`SavePlot1D <algm-SavePlot1D>` has options for writing out
  plotly html files.

- :ref:`ConvertTableToMatrixWorkspace <algm-ConvertTableToMatrixWorkspace>`
  had a bug where the table columns were in a reversed order in the dialogue's combo boxes.
  This is now fixed and the order is correct.

- :ref:`ConvertUnits <algm-ConvertUnits>` will no longer corrupt an in place workspace if the algorithm fails.

- :ref:`ConvertUnits <algm-ConvertUnits>` now has the option to take a workspace with Points as input.
  A property has been added that will make the algorithm convert the workspace to Bins automatically. The output space will be converted back to Points.

- :ref:`SetSample <algm-SetSample>`: Fixed a bug with interpreting the `Center` attribute for cylinders/annuli

- :ref:`ConvertToHistogram <algm-ConvertToHistogram>`: Performance improvement using new HistogramData module,
  3x to 4x speedup.

- :ref:`ConvertToPointData <algm-ConvertToPointData>`: Performance improvement using new HistogramData module,
  3x to 4x speedup.

- :ref:`RenameWorkspace <algm-RenameWorkspace>` and `RenameWorkspaces <algm-RenameWorkspaces>`
  now check if a Workspace with that name already exists in the ADS and gives
  the option to override it.

- :ref:`FindSXPeaks <algm-FindSXPeaks>`: Fixed a bug where peaks with an incorrect TOF would stored for some intrument geometries.

- :ref:`FFT <algm-FFT>` deals correctly with histogram input data. Internally, it converts to point data, and the output is always a point data workspace. (It can be converted to histogram data using :ref:`ConvertToHistogram <algm-ConvertToHistogram>` if required).

-  :ref:`StartLiveData <algm-StartLiveData>` has additional properties for specifying scripts to run for processing and post-processing.

- :ref:`LoadEmptyInstrument <algm-LoadEmptyInstrument>` now also accepts a workspace name as input, as an alternative to an instrument definition xml file.

Deprecated
##########

MD Algorithms (VATES CLI)
#########################

- :ref:`MergeMD <algm-MergeMD>` now preserves the display normalization from the first workspace in the list

Performance
-----------

- The introduction of the HistogramData module may have influenced the performance of some algorithms and many workflows.
  A moderate number of algorithms should experience a speedup and reduced memory consumption.
  If you experience unusual slowdowns, please contact the developer team.

- :ref:`StripPeaks <algm-StripPeaks>` has a slight performance improvement from these changes.


CurveFitting
------------

- Added two new minimizers belonging to the trust region family of algorithms: DTRS and More-Sorensen.
- Added new property `EvaluationType` to Fit algorithm. If set to "Histogram" and the input dataset 
is a histogram with large bins it can improve accuracy of the fit.

Improved
########

Interfaces
----------

New
###

- A workflow gui for TOFTOF data reduction (#17075).
  The gui is accessible through the ``Interfaces / Direct / DGS Reduction`` menu.
  The first time the user is presented with a choice of facilites and instruments -
  choose MLZ / TOFTOF. The choice can be changed later from (any) reduction gui by
  ``Tools / Change instrument ...``.


Python
------

- :py:obj:`mantid.kernel.MaterialBuilder` has been exposed to python
  and :py:obj:`mantid.kernel.Material` has been modified to expose the
  individual atoms.
- :py:obj:`mantid.geometry.OrientedLattice` set U with determinant -1 exposed to python
- The setDisplayNormalization and setDisplayNormalizationHisto methods for MDEventWorkspaces are now exposed to Python

Python Algorithms
#################

- New algorithm :ref:`SelectNexusFilesByMetadata <algm-SelectNexusFilesByMetadata>` provides quick filtering of nexus files based on criteria imposed on metadata.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Scripts generated from history including algorithms that added dynamic properties at run time (for example Fit, and Load) will not not include those dynamic properties in their script.  This means they will execute without warnings.
- Cloning a ``MultiDomainFunction``, or serializing to a string and recreating it, now preserves the domains.
- :ref:`EvaluateFunction <algm-EvaluateFunction>` now works from its dialog in the GUI as well as from a script
