New features
------------

Algorithms
##########

* Remove CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrection v1. This algorithm has been replaced by :ref:`CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrection <algm-CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrection>`

Data Analysis
#############

Elwin
~~~~~

- Additional option to ungroup Elwin output
- When using multiple input files, the naming convention for the outputworkspace contains the `first-final` run number.
  An example of this would be `osi92764-92767_graphite002_red_elwin_elf` for OSIRIS run between 92764-92767

Jump Fit
~~~~~~~~

Improvements
------------

- :ref:`LoadVesuvio <algm-LoadVesuvio>` now uses the whole TOF range for loaded monitor data (0-20000)
- Physical positions were included to the 311 reflection of BASIS instrument for improved instrument view.
- Algorithm :ref:`BASISReduction311 <algm-BASISReduction311>` has been included in algorithm :ref:`BASISReduction <algm-BASISReduction>`.
- Range bars colours in the *ISIS Calibration* interface have been updated to match the convention in the fit wizard.
- Vesuvio sigma_theta value updated for single and double differencing in both forward and back scattering. The new value is 0.016 for all.
- The Elwin interface now uses the resolution of the instrument to create the range bars when possible


Bugfixes
--------


* :ref:`IqtFitMultiple <algm-IqtFitMultiple>` no longer creates an unwanted temporary workspace when executed
* The documentation for :ref:`TransformToIqt <algm-TransformToIqt>` now correctly states that the ParameterWorkspace is a TableWorkspace
* Fix memory leak in :ref:`LoadSassena <algm-LoadSassena>`
* The *ResNorm* interface should no longer crash when using workspaces (rather than files) as input.
* Fix bug showing incorrect doublet peaks in :ref:`ISISIndirectDiffractionReduction <algm-ISISIndirectDiffractionReduction>`
