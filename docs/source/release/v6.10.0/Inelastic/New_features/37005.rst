- A checkbox option is added in Data Manipulation with title "EnfoceNormalization". This option is set to True by default (no change to the current algorithms/workflow occurs). When it is set to False, the LHSWorkspace from the output from ExtractFFTSpectrum is used in both branches to perform the final workspace division and the two intermediate workspace divisions are skipped.
