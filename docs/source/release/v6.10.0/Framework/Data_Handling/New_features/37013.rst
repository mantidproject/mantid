- Introduced file search/loading from instrument data cache on IDAaaS.
  The instrument data cache is the directory ``/data/instrument/`` present on IDAaaS, and contains a local copy of the data archive.
  The instrument data cache is used to search for files before looking in the data archive.
  This new feature fixes the problem of loading files for users who do not have access to the data archive on IDAaaS.
  Please note that if you are not on IDAaaS, avoid creating the directory ``/data/instrument/`` as this will trigger a search for files inside that directory.
