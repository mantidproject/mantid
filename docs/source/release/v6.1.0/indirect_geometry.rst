    putting new features at the top of the section, followed by
    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

New Features
############
- A new algorithm :ref:`IndirectILLReductionDIFF <algm-IndirectILLReductionDIFF>` added for treatment of diffraction detector data from the indirect geometry beamline IN16B at the ILL.
- Three fitting functions `IsoRotDiff`, `DiffSphere` and `DiffRotDiscreteCircle` have been made available in the fitting browser
- `IsoRotDiff`, `DiffSphere` and `DiffRotDiscreteCircle` have been added to the function options in Indirect Data Analysis ConvFit.
- The Abins Algorithm has an additional "setting" option which may be
  used to select between configurations of a given instrument. (For
  TOSCA this is a choice of forward/back detector banks, for Lagrange
  this is a choice between monochromator crystals.)
- Support has been added to Abins for the ILL-Lagrange
  instrument. As Lagrange collects inelastically scattered neutrons
  over a wide solid angle, the spectrum is computed at several angles
  and averaged. Resolution functions are applied depending on the
  monochromator setting.

Improvements
############
- In Indirect Data Analysis F(Q) fit the default fitting function remains None when switching to EISF.
