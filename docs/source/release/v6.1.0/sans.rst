Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug that made it impossible to process flux in SANSILLAutoprocess.
- On D16 using :ref:`SANSILLAutoProcess <algm-SANSILLAutoProcess>`, now use the correct monitor for normalization, fix a bug where processing transmission would yield undefined values at 90 degrees when using ThetaDependent correction, and improve the q binning used.

Improvements
------------

- With SANSILLAutoProcess, the detector distance, the collimation position and the wavelength are appended to the names of the output workspaces (values are taken from the sample logs).
- :ref:`SANSILLAutoProcess <algm-SANSILLAutoProcess>` has new property: `StitchReferenceIndex` to denote the index of ws that should be a reference
  for scaling during stitching
