    putting new features at the top of the section, followed by
    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

New
---

- Sectors drawn in the instrument viewer can now be used to define wedges in :ref:`Q1DWeighted <algm-Q1DWeighted>`.

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug that made it impossible to process flux in SANSILLAutoprocess.
- On D16 using :ref:`SANSILLAutoProcess <algm-SANSILLAutoProcess>`, now use the correct monitor for normalization, fix a bug where processing transmission would yield undefined values at 90 degrees when using ThetaDependent correction, and improve the q binning used.

Improvements
############

- With SANSILLAutoProcess, the detector distance, the collimation position and the wavelength are appended to the names of the output workspaces (values are taken from the sample logs).
- :ref:`SANSILLAutoProcess <algm-SANSILLAutoProcess>` has new property: `StitchReferenceIndex` to denote the index of ws that should be a reference
  for scaling during stitching
- The core algorithm for ISIS SANS reductions underwent a significant rewrite to improve processing wavelength slices.
  For 15 slices the reduction time dropped by 55% compared to the previous release.
- Workspace names for ISIS SANS reductions no longer append the wavelength to the name. The prepended
  wavelength is still present. For example `12345_rear_1d_1.0_10.0_...p0_t4_1.0_10.0` will now be called
  `12345_rear_1d_1.0_10.0_...p0_t4`, where `1.0_10.0` is the wavelength of that workspace.
- :ref:`SANSILLReduction <algm-SANSILLReduction>` has a new property `SolventInputWorkspace`, to provide reduced solvent data to be subtracted from the sample data.
- :ref:`SANSILLAutoProcess <algm-SANSILLAutoProcess>` has a new property `SolventFiles`, to communicate with :ref:`SANSILLReduction <algm-SANSILLReduction>` the file names of the reduced solvent data.
- ISIS SANS can load summed nexus files without requiring "-add" in the name.
- :ref:`SANSILLReduction <algm-SANSILLReduction>` adds sample log information to reduced data about facility,
  sample transmission numor, and all SampleRuns numors, with relevant algebra.
- ISIS SANS can now load summed event transmission data
