New Features
------------

- :ref:`SANSILLReduction <algm-SANSILLReduction>` has a new property `SolventInputWorkspace`, to provide reduced solvent data to be subtracted from the sample data.
- **Sectors drawn in the instrument viewer can now be used to define wedges in** :ref:`Q1DWeighted <algm-Q1DWeighted>`.

Improvements
------------

- :ref:`SANSILLAutoProcess <algm-SANSILLAutoProcess>` has new property: `StitchReferenceIndex` to denote the index of ws that should be a reference for scaling during stitching
- :ref:`SANSILLAutoProcess <algm-SANSILLAutoProcess>` has a new property `SolventFiles`, to communicate with :ref:`SANSILLReduction <algm-SANSILLReduction>` the file names of the reduced solvent data.
- In :ref:`SANSILLAutoProcess <algm-SANSILLAutoProcess>`, the detector distance, the collimation position and the wavelength are appended to the names of the output workspaces (values are taken from the sample logs).
- :ref:`SANSILLReduction <algm-SANSILLReduction>` adds sample log information to reduced data about facility, sample transmission numor, and all SampleRuns numors, with relevant algebra.
- The core algorithm for ISIS SANS reductions underwent a significant rewrite to improve processing wavelength slices. For 15 slices the reduction time dropped by 55% compared to the previous release.
- Workspace names for ISIS SANS reductions no longer append the wavelength to the name. The prepended wavelength is still present. For example `12345_rear_1d_1.0_10.0_...p0_t4_1.0_10.0` will now be called `12345_rear_1d_1.0_10.0_...p0_t4`, where `1.0_10.0` is the wavelength of that workspace.
- ISIS SANS can load summed nexus files without requiring "-add" in the name.
- ISIS SANS can now load summed event transmission data

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug that made it impossible to process flux in SANSILLAutoprocess.
- On D16 using :ref:`SANSILLAutoProcess <algm-SANSILLAutoProcess>`, now uses the correct monitor for normalization, fix a bug where processing transmission would yield undefined values at 90 degrees when using ThetaDependent correction, and improve the q binning used.
- Fixed the ISIS SANS interface crashing if a new row is created using the enter key, then the user immediately uses process or load without clicking away.




:ref:`Release 6.1.0 <v6.1.0>`
