    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

Powder Diffraction
------------------

Improvements
############

- The Polaris scripts can now detect the chopper mode if none is provided using the frequency block logs.

- :ref:`SNSPowderReduction <algm-SNSPowderReduction>` has a new property, ``OffsetData``, which adds a constant to the data at the very end of the reduction.

- Added two new options to the HRPD scripts `do_solid_angle_corrections` and `subtract_empty_instrument` allowing setting whether or not these actions should take place.

- :ref:`BASISPowderDiffraction <algm-BASISPowderDiffraction>` has a new property, ``RemoveTemp``, which allows the user to inspect temporary workspaces is left unchecked.

- :ref:`LoadSampleEnvironment <algm-LoadSampleEnvironment>` now correctly takes into account scale for translation. Rotation is now applied before translation to reduce confusion.

- The Pearl scripts now automatically disable attenuation on long-mode.

Bug Fixes
#########

- HRPD Absorption corrections now correctly takes into account the thickness of the slab.

- Pearl no longer produces an output of NaN when long-mode is changed after focusing.

Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------

Improvements
############

- Changed focus to save out .his files in the format <run-number><instrument> as opposed to <run-number>_<instrument> to allow for better compatibility with opengenie.
- Added sample environment file for POWGEN that includes many of the standard sample containers

Bug Fixes
#########

- Prevented crash caused by canceling algorithms called by GUI.

- Prevented GUI breaking bug caused by entering files from the wrong instrument to calibration.

- Prevented issue with reading CSV files on python 3

- GUI now correctly loads the file browsed to instead of looking for a run number in every folder along the path to that file.

- :ref:`MDNorm <algm-MDNorm>` will not crash if the detector is masked in the flux workspace, but not in the input workspace.


Single Crystal Diffraction
--------------------------

New Algorithms
##############

- New algorithm :ref:`PredictSatellitePeaks <algm-PredictSatellitePeaks>` to predict satellite peaks using modulation vectors and maximum order of satellite from PeaksWorkspace or range of wavelength and DSpacing.

- New algorithm :ref:`IndexPeaksWithSatellites <algm-IndexPeaksWithSatellites>` to index peaks with satellites and set modulation vectors and maximum order of satellite from input values.


Improvements
############
- :ref:`LoadIsawPeaks <algm-LoadIsawPeaks>` will load satellite peaks using the order of each satellite by the hkl of the nuclear peak and the mnp of the satellite peak.

- :ref:`SaveIsawPeaks <algm-SaveIsawPeaks>` will save satellite peaks using the order of each satellite by the hkl of the nuclear peak and the mnp of the satellite peak.

- :ref:`FindUBUsingIndexedPeaks <algm-FindUBUsingIndexedPeaks>` finds UB matrix using the indexed peaks, modulation vectors and maximum order of satellite from PeaksWorkspace.

- :ref:`IndexPeaks <algm-IndexPeaks>` now will also index satellite peaks using modulation vectors and maximum order of satellite from PeaksWorkspace.

- :ref:`IntegrateEllipsoids <algm-IntegrateEllipsoids>` will integrate peaks using the indexed peaks, modulation vectors and maximum order of satellite from PeaksWorkspace

- :ref:`DeltaPDF3D <algm-DeltaPDF3D>` has a new method for peak removal, KAREN (K-space Algorithmic REconstructioN)
