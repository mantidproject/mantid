Installation
############

- Linux desktops now have an icon to launch the workbench without using the terminal.

User interface
##############

- All icons have been replaced with icons from Material Design: https://material.io/tools/icons.
- You can now double-click the numbers on a figure axis to adjust the axis' scale.
- Mantid's offline help is now available in Workbench.
- You can now save, load and delete custom layouts from the settings menu with quick access to user layout in the view
  menu.
- Typing an algorithm name in the algorithms search box now searches all algorithms including those in hidden categories.

SliceViewer
-----------
- We have merged much of the functionality of the Spectrum Viewer and Slice Viewer from Mantidplot into a single useful tool.
- It works much like the previous SliceViewer tool, plotting any MatrixWorkspace or MDWorkspaces, and  allowing the 2 axes for plotting to be selected, while presenting a slider for additional dimensions.
- The side plot toolbar button (that looks like a curve plot) adds line plot vertically and horizontally that will dynamically update as you move your mouse cursor across the plot.
- Support for some of the more advanced features of the old sliceViewer such as non-orthogonal axes, extracting slices to other workspaces and displying peaks will be included in future releases.

Scientific Interfaces
---------------------
- Many of the interfaces that were missing from Workbench v4.0 have now been integrated into this release, including:

  - ISIS Reflectometry
  - Muon:

    - ALC
    - Elemental Analysis
    - Frequency Domain Analysis
    - Muon Analysis 2

  - Indirect:

    - Corrections
    - Data Reduction
    - Diffraction
    - Settings
    - Simulations
    - Tools

Plotting
--------

- The plot options dialog has been improved to offer you more control over your figures.
- You can now plot workspaces on top of figures you've created using scripts. Simply create a matplotlib figure in the
  script window, then drag and drop a workspace on top of it.
- A colorfill plot of a workspace with logarithmic bins is plotted on a log scale.
- You can now toggle the normalization of plots in Workbench from the plot's context menu.
- Double-clicking a workspace now opens a prompt to plot the workspace, instead of displaying its data.
- The plot windows now have a Mouse right-click context menu that allows showing/hiding error bars for each plotted line.

Scripting
#########
- Single line commenting in the script editor is now enabled without needing to highlight any text.
- You can now import from local python files that are in the same directory as the script you're executing.

Bugfixes
########
- An error raised when double-clicking an arrow in the algorithm toolbox.
  when no algorithm was selected has been fixed.
- Help documentation for the manage user directories interface now correctly displays when launched from the interface.
- A Colorfill plot of a workspace with one spectrum plots correctly and no longer raises an error.
- The units on the y-axis of distribution workspace plots have been corrected.
- Restore Default Layout no longer resizes the main window.
- Entering an invalid number into a plot's axis editor no longer causes an uncaught error
- Workbench's scaling of fonts when moved between monitors with different resolutions has been improved
- The ErrorReporter window is now resizeable
- The "Fit" button is now visible when plotting a spectrum with error bars
- Project save handles workspace saving erros more gracefully

Known Issues
############

- Fit parameters in the fit browser are not updated when performing a simultaneous fit.
- The fit and difference curves are not plotted on the associated figure for a simultaneous fit.
