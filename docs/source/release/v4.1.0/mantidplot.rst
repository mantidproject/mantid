Improvements
############

The vast majority of development effort for user interfaces is now directed towards the :doc:`Mantid workbench <mantidworkbench>`, for now only significant bugs will be fixed within MantidPlot.

Bugfixes
########

* Help documentation for the manage user directories interface now correctly displays when launched from the interface.
* Fix for the Instrument View pick tab miniplot where the x axis label was not updated when a new unit was selected.
* The ErrorReporter window is now resizeable
* Save button is now disabled while a project is being saved, stopping the same project being needlessly saved multiple times.

:ref:`Release 4.1.0 <v4.1.0>`
