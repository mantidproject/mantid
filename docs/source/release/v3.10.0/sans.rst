Features
--------
- Add functionality to handle event-mode monitors. This can be used to perform time slicing of the transission measurement.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed wrong first spectrum number for LARMOR. The first non-monitor spectrum number is 11, but it had been set to 10.
- Fixed inconsistent detector selection for high-angle-bank-type detectors.
- Fixed LOQ Batch mode bug where geometry information was not saved out when using SaveCanSAS1D.
- Fixed LOQ Batch mode bug where custom user file without a .txt ending was not being picked up.
- Fixed Batch mode bug where the output name suffix was hardcoded to SANS2D. It now takes the individual instruments into account.
- Fixed LOQ bug where prompt peak was not set correctly for monitor normalisation.
- Fixed Batch mode bug where merged reductions set in the GUI were not respected.
- Fixed display of current IDF, which was not updated when operating in batch mode.
