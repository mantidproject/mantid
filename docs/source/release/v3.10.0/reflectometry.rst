Reflectometry Changes
=====================

.. contents:: Table of Contents
   :local:

- Geometry for ``INTER`` has a small correction for the value of one of the attributes that was being intepreted as zero.

Algorithms
----------

- :ref:`algm-SpecularReflectionPositionCorrect` - fixed a bug where entering
  an invalid detector or sample name would cause a segmentation fault.
- The :ref:`algm-SpecularReflectionPositionCorrect` algorithm has a new property, ``DetectorCorrectionType``,
  which specifies whether detector positions should be corrected by a vertical  shift (default) or by a rotation around the sample position.
- :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneAuto-v2` and :ref:`algm-CreateTransmissionWorkspaceAuto-v2` attempts to populate properties `StartOverlap` and `EndOverlap` with values from the IDF.
- :ref:`algm-GroupDetectors-v2` peforms a more resilient validation of grouping pattern that is less likely to throw an exception.

Reflectometry Reduction Interface
---------------------------------

ISIS Reflectometry
##################

- Interface `ISIS Reflectometry (Polref)` has been renamed to `ISIS Reflectometry`.
- Fixed a bug where the contents of the processing table where not saved to the selected table workspace.
- Added two new buttons `Expand Groups` and `Collapse Groups` which expand and collapse all groups in the table respectively.
- Fixed a bug when removing rows from the processing table.
- Fixed a bug where if either `Instrument` and/or `Experiments` was disabled, their respective entries would still be applied in the reduction.
- Fixed shortcuts:

  - Ctrl+C copies the selected row(s) to the clipboard.
  - Ctrl+V pastes the contents of the clipboard into the selected row(s). If no rows are selected, new ones are added at the end.
  - Ctrl+X copies the selected row(s) to the clipboard and deletes them.

- A brief description about the columns in the table can be now accessed by using the *What's this* tool (last tool in the toolbar) and clicking on the column headers.
- Fixed a bug in which the `IvsQ_binned` output workspaces were stitched instead of `IvsQ` workspaces.
- Added two more time slicing options in the 'Event Handling' tab for analysing event data - Uniform Even and Uniform slicing.
- For custom slicing (and new slicing options), workspace slices are now identified by an index (e.g. ws_slice_0) instead of a start/stop time.
- The 'Get Defaults` button for 'Experiment Settings' in the 'Settings' tab now populates `StartOverlap` and `EndOverlap` text boxes with values from the IDF.
