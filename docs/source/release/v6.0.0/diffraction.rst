    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

Powder Diffraction
------------------
New features
############
- New algorithm to clip peaks, providing a background estimation :ref:`ClipPeaks <algm-ClipPeaks>`.
- Scripts for pixel calibration of CORELLI 16-packs. Produce a calibration table, a masking table, and a goodness of fit workspace.

Improvements
############
- :ref:`WANDPowderReduction <algm-WANDPowderReduction>` now accepts a sequence of input workspaces, combining them to reduce to a single spectrum.

New features
############

- Remove _noatten workspace that was produced by the Pearl powder diffraction scripts when run with perform_attenuation=True

Bugfixes
########

- Dummy detectors in polaris workspaces no longer prevent unit conversion.

Engineering Diffraction

Single Crystal Diffraction
--------------------------

New features
############
- Scripts for pixel calibration of CORELLI 16-packs. Produce a calibration table, a masking table, and a goodness of fit workspace.
- Fix problem that was causing matrix diagonalization to return NaNs in certain cases. The diagonalization is used in :ref:`CalculateUMatrix <algm-CalculateUMatrix>` and :ref:`IntegratePeaksMD <algm-IntegratePeaksMD>`
