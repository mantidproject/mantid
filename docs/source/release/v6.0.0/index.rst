.. contents:: Table of Contents
   :local:

We are proud to announce version 6.0.0 of Mantid.

**This is the first release only featuring** :doc:`MantidWorkbench <mantidworkbench>`

The last release of MantidPlot was :ref:`version 5.1.1<v5.1.1>`.

This release welcomes some minor features to make Workbench feature complete, including migrating the Step Scan interface
and allowing control of InstrumentViewer from Python.

Other highlights include:

- :doc:`ISIS Reflectometry <reflectometry>` allows runs to be excluded or annotated
- Further plot settings, including tick customisation and axis autoscaling
- Upgraded support for ILL instruments D1B, D2B, D20 and IN16B
- Several improvements to SliceViewer and diffraction fitting, including the reliability of :ref:`func-BackToBackExponential`
- :doc:`Muon and Frequency Domain Analysis <muon>` support multiple runs with the co-add option

These are just some of the many improvements in this release, so please take a
look at the release notes, which are filled with details of the
important changes and improvements in many areas. The development team
has put a great effort into making all of these improvements within
Mantid, and we would like to thank all of our beta testers for their
time and effort helping us to make this another reliable version of Mantid.

Throughout the Mantid project we put a lot of effort into ensuring
Mantid is a robust and reliable product. Thank you to everyone that has
reported any issues to us. Please keep on reporting any problems you
