New Features
############

- Added a colorbar scale option to the workbench plot settings. This allows the user to choose between a linear (default) or logarithmic scale.

Improvements
############

- Enable workbench to plot 1D spectrum (plot, overplot, plot_with_error, overplot_with_error) from an IMDHistoWorkspace whose non-integrated dimension is equal to 1 but not to launch slice viewer.
- Enabled the plotting of individual functions in the Workbench fit browser. This replicates a feature that was in MantidPlot.
  Plotting of each function can be performed by right clicking on the function within the browser and selecting plot.
- Add the possibility to copy and paste shapes in the instrument viewer using Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V.

Bugfixes
########

- Only display slice viewer widget for MDEventWorkspaces with 2 or more dimensions.
