Features
---------

- Make added multi-period event files available for the ISIS SANS reduction.
- Added NXcanSAS as an output format of the ISIS SANS Gui.


Bug Fixes

|

- Fix for LARMOR multi-period loading. The initial rotation was not correctly applied to all child workspaces.
- IDF bug when using Larmor in batch mode was resolved.
- Issue where Gui changes were not picked up for batch reductions was resolved.

X uncertainties (delta-Q)
-------------------------

- X uncertainties (Dx) are now always stored as one value per *bin*, i.e., not as one value per *bin edge*.
- When loading legacy Nexus files (files with Dx data that were stored with previous Mantid versions) the last Dx value is ignored.
