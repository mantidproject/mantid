Crystal Improvements
--------------------
:ref:`algm-FindUBUsingLatticeParameters` will now return an oriented lattice even when the number of peaks used is very low.
:ref:`algm-FindUBUsingLatticeParameters` has a new option to fix lattice parameters. This will find an orientation, but without optimisation between indexed HKLs and q vectors.

Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------

Powder Diffraction
------------------

:ref:`algm-SNSPowderReduction` had an error in logic of subtracting the vanadium background. It was not being subtracted when ``PreserveEvents=True``.

:ref:`algm-PDLoadCharacterizations` and
:ref:`algm-PDDetermineCharacterizations` have been upgraded to support
sample container specific information, as well as additional
information about the empty sample environment and instrument.

:ref:`algm-SetDetScale` has a new option, DetScaleFile, to input a text file with each line containing the detector number and scale factor for that detector.  These scales will be used in SaveHKL and AnvredCorrection.  If scales for a detector are given in both the DetScaleList text string and the DetScaleFile file, the values from the text string will be used.
