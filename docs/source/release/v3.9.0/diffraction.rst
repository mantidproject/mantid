Crystal Improvements
--------------------
:ref:`algm-FindUBUsingLatticeParameters` will now return an oriented lattice even when the number of peaks used is very low.

:ref:`algm-FindUBUsingLatticeParameters` has a new option to fix lattice parameters. This will find an orientation, but without optimisation between indexed HKLs and q vectors.

:ref:`algm-CreateGroupingWorkspace` has a new option to create one group of 4 columns of SNAP detectors and another with the remaining 2 columns. This grouping is used frequently in their reduction.

:ref:`algm-IntegratePeaksMD` now removes the top 1% of the background events so that intensity spikes near the edges are removed.

:ref:`algm-IntegrateEllipsoids` has a new option, AdaptiveQMultiplier, for the radius to vary as a function of the modulus of Q. If the AdaptiveQBackground option is set to True, the background radius also changes.  These are the same as the adaptive options in :ref:`algm-IntegratePeaksMD`.

General Diffraction
-------------------
A new version of :ref:`algm-ConvertToDiffractionMDWorkspace-v3` has been created that now automatically calculates extents using :ref:`algm-ConvertToMDMinMaxLocal` if none are provided.

Single Crystal Diffraction
--------------------------
HB3A's IDF is modified to allow its detector center shifted from default position.
:ref:`algm-LoadSpiceXML2DDet` has new options for users to input amount of detector's shift in X and Y direction.
:ref:`algm-ConvertCWSDExpToMomentum` has new options for users to input amount of detector's shift in X and Y direction.
User interface *HFIR 4Circle Reduction* has been modified to allow user to specify wave length, detector center and distance between detector and sample.

Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------
:ref:`algm-SaveOpenGenieAscii` has been rewritten and works with the analyze_scan procedure in OpenGenie. It should also work with other procedures that use a standard set of parameters.

Powder Diffraction
------------------

:ref:`algm-SNSPowderReduction` had an error in logic of subtracting the vanadium background. It was not being subtracted when ``PreserveEvents=True``.

:ref:`algm-PDLoadCharacterizations` and
:ref:`algm-PDDetermineCharacterizations` have been upgraded to support
sample container specific information, as well as additional
information about the empty sample environment and instrument.

:ref:`algm-SetDetScale` has a new option, DetScaleFile, to input a text file with each line containing the detector number and scale factor for that detector.  These scales will be used in SaveHKL and AnvredCorrection.  If scales for a detector are given in both the DetScaleList text string and the DetScaleFile file, the values from the text string will be used.

High Pressure
-------------

:ref:`algm-CreateGroupingWorkspace` has a new option to create one group of 4 columns of SNAP detectors and another with the remaining 2 columns. This grouping is used frequently in their reduction.

:ref:`algm-SNAPReduce` is new to mantid, but not for SNAP
users. Adding the algorithm to mantid installations will reduce the
amount of issues that SNAP users will encounter trying to reduce their
data.

New scripts for correcting diamond anvil cell attenuation. These are found in `scripts/DiamondAttenuationCorrection <https://github.com/peterfpeterson/mantid/tree/diamond_atten/scripts/DiamondAttenuationCorrection>`_.
