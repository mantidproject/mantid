Algorithms

- :ref:`algm-Stitch1D` documentation has been improved, it now includes a workflow diagram illustrating the different steps in the calculation and a note about how errors are propagated.
- :ref:`Stitch1DMany <algm-Stitch1DMany>` has a new property 'ScaleFactorFromPeriod' which enables it to apply scale factors from a particular period when stitching group workspaces.

Reflectometry Reduction Interface
---------------------------------

ISIS Reflectometry (Polref)

- Settings tab now displays individual global options for experiment and instrument settings.
- New 'Save ASCII' tab added, similar in function and purpose to the 'Save Workspaces' window accessible from Interfaces->ISIS Reflectometry->File->Save Workspaces.
- When runs are transferred to the processing table groups are now labeled according to run title.
- Column :literal:`dQ/Q` is used as the rebin parameter to stitch workspaces.
- Fixed a bug where if the user answered 'no' to a popup asking if they wanted to process all runs, the progress bar would show activity as though a data reduction was occurring.
- The interface is now arranged in two different groups. Groups apply to tabs 'Run' and 'Settings'.
- Documentation regarding the interface has been updated accordingly.
- Error messages are displayed if the user either attempts to transfer zero runs or transfer runs with a different strategy to the one they used to search for runs with.
