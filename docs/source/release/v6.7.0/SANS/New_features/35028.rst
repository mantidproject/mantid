- Minimum and maximum thresholds for calculated efficiency are now exposed to the users of :ref:`SANSILLReduction <algm-SANSILLReduction>` algorithms (version 1 and 2), as well as higher-level algorithms calling them: :ref:`SANSILLAutoProcess <algm-SANSILLAutoProcess>`, :ref:`SANSILLMultiProcess <algm-SANSILLMultiProcess>`, and :ref:`SANSILLParameterScan <algm-SANSILLParameterScan>`. This allows to avoid the issue of calculated efficiency surpassing the default limit (0 and 2, respectively) and being set to -inf.
