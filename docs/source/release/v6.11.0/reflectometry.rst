New Features
------------
- New algorithm :ref:`algm-PolarizationEfficienciesWildes` has been added for calculating the efficiencies of the polarizing components of an instrument with two flippers.
  This algorithm implements the approach from the A. R. Wildes 2006 paper `doi: 10.1080/10448630600668738 <https://doi.org/10.1080/10448630600668738>`_.

Bugfixes
--------
- :ref:`Stitch1DMany <algm-Stitch1DMany-v1>` algorithm now runs without errors via the dialog for executing algorithms.
- The ``orsopy`` library has been updated to version 1.2.1.
  This pulls in a bug fix where multi-dataset reduced reflectivity ``.ort`` files with different column headers for different datasets would use only the headers for the first dataset throughout the file.
- Algorithm :ref:`algm-ReflectometryReductionOneLiveData` now applies polarization corrections correctly on ``WorkspaceGroup`` inputs.
- When on IDAaaS, only runs that are available in the ISIS Instrument Data Cache will now appear in the ``Search Runs``
  section of the :ref:`Runs tab <refl_runs>` when the ``Search Data Archive`` setting is set to ``Off``.
