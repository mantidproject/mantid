Bugfixes
--------
- Fixed a bug on the Energy Transfer tab of the :ref:`Indirect Data Reduction <interface-indirect-data-reduction>` interface where the first raw file would be loaded into the ADS but never deleted.
- Reduced files from the :ref:`Indirect Data Reduction <interface-indirect-data-reduction>` interface now have spectra numbering consistent for a summed file reduction compared to individual file reduction.
- :ref:`interface-indirect-simulation` interface no longer crashes after clicking ``Run`` without loading data.


:ref:`Release 6.11.0 <v6.11.0>`
