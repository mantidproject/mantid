- Improve determination of background bins by minimising third-moment (skew) in :ref:`IntegratePeaksSkew <algm-IntegratePeaksSkew>` by forcing skew > 0 (minimum skew would expect in background)
- Add cabability to not integrate peaks which include a masked detector in the following algorithms

  - :ref:`IntegratePeaksSkew <algm-IntegratePeaksSkew>`
  - :ref:`IntegratePeaksShoeboxTOF <algm-IntegratePeaksShoeboxTOF>`
