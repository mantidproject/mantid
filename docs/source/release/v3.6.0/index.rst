We are proud to announce version 3.6 of Mantid, this release contains
the long awaited support to handle the differing Crystallography
convention (:math:`k_f-k_i`) and inelastic convention (:math:`k_i-k_f`) for representing HKL
and Q space data.

This is just one of many improvements in this release, so please take a
look at the release notes, which are filled with details of the
important changes and improvements in many areas. The development team
has put a great effort into making all of these improvements within
Mantid, and we would like to thank all of our beta testers for their
time and effort helping us to make this another reliable version of Mantid.

Throughout the Mantid project we put a lot of effort into ensuring
Mantid is a robust and reliable product. Thank you to everyone that has
