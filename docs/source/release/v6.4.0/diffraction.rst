Powder Diffraction
------------------

New Features
############

- The NOMAD Instrument Definition File geometry was updated based on new survey positions.
- Added in the capability to normalize data with collection time in :ref:`HB2AReduce <algm-HB2AReduce>`.

Bugfixes
########

- Fixed an issue in :ref:`SNSPowderReduction <algm-SNSPowderReduction>` causing a failure if a reduction was repeated twice.


Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------

New Features
############

- Added a loader for the ILL SALSA instrument.

Bugfixes
########

* Fixed two problems when loading a project that includes the :ref:`Engineering Diffraction interface<Engineering_Diffraction-ref>`:

  * resolved a crash when a user loads a project containing a workspace that was plotted on the :ref:`Fitting tab <ui engineering fitting>`.
  * minimizing the main Workbench window also minimizes the Engineering Diffraction interface created from the project load.

* Fixed a bug in the :ref:`Fitting tab <ui engineering fitting>` of the :ref:`Engineering Diffraction interface<Engineering_Diffraction-ref>` where the default list of files contains all previously focused files rather than the last ones generated by the last focus action.
* On first time start up of the :ref:`Engineering Diffraction interface<Engineering_Diffraction-ref>`, the default save location is now utilised for
  calibration and focus files.



:ref:`Release 6.4.0 <v6.4.0>`
