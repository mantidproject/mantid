- A new graphical tool has been added to the ISIS Reflectometry interface to allow interactive selection of various regions of interest. It shows an on-the-fly preview showing the effect of the selections on the reduced reflectivity curve. It also adds the ability to select and sum across segments on a 2D detector. See the :ref:`Reduction Preview <refl_preview>` documentation for more detail.
