- On the GSASII tab, when a successful refinement is run, the output table workspace for the lattice parameters
  now includes the Microstrain value and the column title is marked when this parameter has been refined.
  A similar instrument parameter table workspace is now also generated which includes Sigma-1 and Gamma(Y),
  with a refined flag, and the fitting range. The Pawley reflections are output to a separate table workspace
  if they are available.
