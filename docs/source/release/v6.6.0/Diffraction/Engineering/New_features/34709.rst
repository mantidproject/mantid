- On the GSASII tab, when a successful refinement is run, the output table workspace for the lattice parameters
  now includes the Microstrain value and the column title is marked when this parameter has been refined.
  A similar instrument parameter table workspace is now also generated which includes Sigma-1 and Gamma(Y),
  with a refined flag, and the fitting range. The Pawley reflections are output to a separate table workspace
  if they are available.
- The GSASII tab outputs the sample logs attached to the relevant focused data, as specified in the Engineering
  Diffraction settings. This behaves in the same way as before for the fitting tab.
