* Added new option to :ref:`IntegratePeaksSkew <algm-IntegratePeaksSkew>`: to get initial TOF window from back-to-back exponential coefficients if specified in the instrument parameters.xml
* Added back-to-back exponential coefficients to SXD parameters.xml file
* Simplified input arguments to :ref:`IntegratePeaksSkew <algm-IntegratePeaksSkew>`: the parameter `FractionalTOFWindow` has been removed, if a user wants to integrate with an initial window dTOF/TOF = constant for all peaks then this can be achieved by setting ThetaWidth = 0 - note this is technically a breaking change.
