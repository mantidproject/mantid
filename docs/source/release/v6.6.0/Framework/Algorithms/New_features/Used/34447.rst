- To allow files saved with :ref:`SaveAscii2 <algm-SaveAscii-v2>` to be reloaded into Mantid and preserve rebinning behaviour, a ``Distribution=true`` flag is now written in the file header if the workspace is a Distribution. In this case, a column header is always written, even if the Save property ``ColumnHeader`` is set to false.
- To load an Ascii file, that was saved without a Distribution header flag, and set it as a Distribution, execute :ref:`LoadAscii2 <algm-LoadAscii-v2>` with property ``ForceDistributionTrue=true``
