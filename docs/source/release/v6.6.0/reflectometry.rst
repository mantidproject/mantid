New Features
------------
- :ref:`ReflectometryISISLoadAndProcess <algm-ReflectometryISISLoadAndProcess>` can now take a polarization efficiencies workspace to make polarization corrections. This workspace can be set via the ``Polarization Efficiencies`` combo box on the :ref:`Experiment Settings tab <refl_exp_instrument_settings>`.
- A new graphical tool has been added to the ISIS Reflectometry interface to allow interactive selection of various regions of interest. It shows an on-the-fly preview showing the effect of the selections on the reduced reflectivity curve. It also adds the ability to select and sum across segments on a 2D detector. See the :ref:`Reduction Preview <refl_preview>` documentation for more detail.

- It is now possible to provide a calibration file on the :ref:`Instrument Settings <refl_exp_instrument_settings>` tab of the ISIS Reflectometry interface. The calibration step will be applied as part of pre-processing when a reduction is run or previewed. See :ref:`ReflectometryISISLoadAndProcess <algm-ReflectometryISISLoadAndProcess>` for more details.
- :ref:`LoadILLReflectometry <algm-LoadILLReflectometry>` can now load NeXus files v3 from D17 and FIGARO measurements from cycle 192 onwards.
- Gravity correction has been implemented for FIGARO data reduction in :ref:`ReflectometryILLPreProcess <algm-ReflectometryILLPreProcess>` and :ref:`ReflectometryILLConvertToQ <algm-ReflectometryILLConvertToQ>`.
- :ref:`ReflectometryILLAutoProcess <algm-ReflectometryILLAutoProcess>` now outputs configuration ``.out`` file containing a summary of the performed reduction.
- :ref:`ReflectometryILLAutoProcess <algm-ReflectometryILLAutoProcess>` does not have the ``UseManualScaleFactors`` boolean property to decide whether to use provided manual scale factors. The redundancy has been removed and now, when the factors are provided, they will be used in :ref:`Stitch <algm-Stitch>` algorithm.
- ``default-incident-monitor-spectrum`` has been corrected for D17 from 257 to 256, allowing for proper monitor normalisation for data from cycle 211 and beyond.
- It is now possible to save the content of the ``Search Runs`` table into a ``.csv`` file, allowing the table to be used as a logbook.

Bugfixes
--------
- Settings are no longer cleared on existing batch tabs when adding a new batch for instruments other than INTER.
- :ref:`ReflectometryILLSumForeground <algm-ReflectometryILLSumForeground>` now properly sums the foreground of the direct beam over the same range as the reflected beam, which fixes observed issues with reflectivity calculation.
- Live data now only updates with the final IvsQ result, avoiding the axes changing during processing.
- The live data monitor now continues running when it encounters a transmission run by handling angles of zero.
- Fixed an issue where Mantid could crash when workspaces were cleared from the ADS after deleting a batch from the :ref:`interface-isis-refl`.
- Stop using the value of the ``ScaleRHSWorkspace`` parameter of :ref:`algm-Stitch1DMany` in favour of the ``IndexOfReference`` parameter.
