- Multiple wavelength ranges can now be processed in a single call to ``WavRangeReduction``. This is more efficient than calling the function separately for each range. To do this, pass the start/end values as lists, e.g. for ranges "1-2, 3-4, 5-6" pass ``wav_start=[1, 3, 5]`` and ``wav_end=[2, 4, 6]``.
