-  Added the Frequency Domain Analysis GUI. At present it is only able to transform data from real space to frequency space. Includes FFT and Maximum entropy methods.
- Updated the TF asymmetry fit. It now works with multiple fitting.
- Moved the TF Asymmetry checkbox to the data analysis tab.  

Bug Fixes
---------
- Mantid would crash when multiple period data was used in single fits (in muon analysis). This has been fixed. 
- Fixed crash when loading data into MuonAnalysis after using Add/Remove curves.
