- Algorithm proprties with long values are now shown in a shortened format both in this display and the log.  The full history is still retained, and genereated python scripts will still work as before.

Custom Interfaces
#################

- General > Multi dataset fitting interface and the general fitting dock now display the status string returned by the `Fit` algorithm. If an error occured during fitting it will be reported in this string.
- Indirect ILL calibration tab, deprecated since v3.9 is now dropped.
- SANS > ISIS SANS v2 experimental interface has become available. It has basic reduction functionalities and makes use of the new reduction backend.

Bugs Resolved
-------------
- Fixed a bug causing table windows with string values to appear truncated if the string contained a space.

SliceViewer Improvements
------------------------

- SliceViewer input of number of bins, thickness, and slice point now waits until the editing is finished to rebin or changing slice point instead of changing with each digit entered.

VSI Improvements
----------------
- ParaView has been updated to to `v5.4.0 <https://blog.kitware.com/paraview-5-4-0-release-notes/>`_.

.. figure:: ../../images/LaNaF4_3D_Slices.png
   :class: screenshot
   :align: right

- Multislice view uses a custom `representation <https://www.paraview.org/ParaView/index.php/Views_And_Representations>`_ to speed up slicing by taking advantage of the consistent bin 
  sizes in a MDHistoWorkspace. Smooth interaction with typical data sizes (< 10 million cells) is now possible.
