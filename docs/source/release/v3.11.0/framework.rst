Concepts
--------
- The reference frame in :ref:`IDF <InstrumentDefinitionFile>` can now be customized in terms of setting the axis defining the 2theta sign.

Properties
----------

- The :ref:`IndexProperty` has been added to the list of property types.

Algorithms
----------

New
###

- :ref:`ConjoinXRuns <algm-ConjoinXRuns>` performs concatenation of the workspaces into a single one by handling the sample logs merging as in :ref:`MergeRuns <algm-MergeRuns>`.
- :ref:`LoadSESANS <algm-LoadSESANS-v1>` Loading SESANS data to a MatrixWorkspace is now supported.
- :ref:`SaveSESANS <algm-SaveSESANS-v1>` Saving a workspace using the SESANS format is now supported.  
- :ref:`algm-IntegrateEPP` integrates a workspace around the elastic peak positions given in an EPP table.

Improved


- :ref:`ConjoinWorkspaces <algm-ConjoinWorkspaces-v1>` provides option to change Y axis unit and label.
- :ref:`FilterEvents <algm-FilterEvents-v1>` has refactored on splitting sample logs.
- :ref:`FilterEvents <algm-FilterEvents-v1>` now copies units for the logs in the filtered workspaces
- :ref:`GroupDetectors <algm-GroupDetectors-v2>` now supports workspaces with detector scans.
- :ref:`FindPeaksMD <algm-FindPeaksMD-v1>` allows now to normalize by the number of events. This can improve results for data that was originally based on histogram data which has been converted to event-mode.
- :ref:`FindSXPeaks <algm-FindSXPeaks-v1>` now finds all peaks in each spectrum. It also allows for setting more fine-grained resolutions and takes into account any goniometer set on the workspace.
- :ref:`SimpleShapeMonteCarloAbsorption <algm-SimpleShapeMonteCarloAbsorption>` has been added to simplify sample environment inputs for MonteCarloAbsorption
- :ref:`IntegreatePeaksMD <algm-IntegratePeaksMD-v2>` makes the culling of the top one percent of the background events optional.
- :ref:`IntegrateEllipsoids <algm-IntegrateEllipsoids-v1>` has the culling of the top one percent of the background events now as an optional input.
- :ref:`IntegrateEllipsoidsTwoStep <algm-IntegrateEllipsoidsTwoStep-v1>` has the culling of the top one percent of the background events now as an optional input.
- :ref:`IntegreatePeaksMD <algm-IntegratePeaksMD-v2>` makes the culling of the top one percent of the background events optional.
- :ref:`Load <algm-Load-v1>` now supports use of tilde in file paths in Python, for example Load(Filename="~/data/test.nxs", ...)
- :ref:`LoadBBY <algm-LoadBBY-v1>` is now better at handling sample information.
- :ref:`algm-MonteCarloAbsorption` now supports approximating the input instrument with a sparse grid of detectors enabling quick simulation of huge pixel arrays. Also, the NumberOfWavelengthPoints input property is now validated more rigorously.
- :ref:`SaveGSS <algm-SaveGSS-v1>` now supports saving in the legacy GSAS ALT format. This is useful for older tools however the default format FXYE should be used whenever possible.
- :ref:`SaveMDWorkspaceToVTK <algm-SaveMDWorkspaceToVTK-v1>` and :ref:`LoadVTK <algm-LoadVTK-v1>` algorithms are now accessible from python.
- :ref:`MergeRuns <algm-MergeRuns-v1>` will now merge workspaces with detector scans.
- :ref:`SetUncertainties <algm-SetUncertainties-v1>` now provides a "custom" mode, which lets the user specify both an arbitrary error value whose occurences are to be replaced in the input workspace, as well as the value to replace it with.
- :ref:`SimpleShapeMonteCarloAbsorption <algm-SimpleShapeMonteCarloAbsorption>` has been added to simplify sample environment inputs for MonteCarloAbsorption
- :ref:`SumSpectra <algm-SumSpectra-v1>`: Fixed a bug where a wrong fallback value would be used in case of invalid values being set for min/max worspace index, and improved input validation for those properties.
- :ref:`LoadBBY <algm-LoadBBY-v1>`: Fixed bug where the logManager did not work with sample_name, sample_aperture and source_aperture. Also added more information regarding the sample and the selected choppers.
- :ref:`ConvertSpectrumAxis <algm-ConvertSpectrumAxis-v2>`: Added an option to disable the sorting of the resulting axis making it useful especially for scanning workspaces. Also reduced the complexity of the operation for the default (ordered axis) case from *NË†2* to *N*.

MD Algorithms (VATES CLI)
#########################

Performance
-----------
- Performance of UB indexing routines addressed. `:ref:`FindUBUsingLatticeParameters` running 2x faster than before.

Core Framework Changes
----------------------

Several changes to the core of how instrument geometry is stored and accessed. These changes have resulted in a few noteworthy performance improvements.

- Partial loading of event nexus files has improved by 22%.
- The LoadNexusMonitors algorithm has improved by 30%.
- The ConvertSpectrumAxis algorithm has improved by 8%.

CurveFitting
------------

New
###

- :ref:`PrimStretchedExpFT <func-PrimStretchedExpFT>` Provides the Fourier Transform of the Symmetrized Stretched Exponential Function integrated over each energy bin. Use in place of :ref:`StretchedExpFT <func-StretchedExpFT>` for fitting sample data featuring relaxation times longer than the resolution of the instrument.
- :ref:`GramCharlier <func-GramCharlier>` is a new fit function primarily for use in neutron compton scattering.
- :ref:`SplineInterpolation <algm-SplineInterpolation>` is extended to support also linear interpolation, if only 2 points are given.

Bug fixes
#########

- :ref:`CubicSpline <func-CubicSpline>` is fixed to sort the y-values and x-values correctly.

Improved
########

Python
------

- :py:obj:`mantid.kernel.MaterialBuilder` had an issue when setting the mass density with more than one atom in the chemical formula. This is now fixed, so the number density is correctly set in :py:obj:`mantid.kernel.Material` and the cross sections correctly calculated.

Python Algorithms
#################

Bugfixes
########

- :ref:`MatchPeaks <algm-MatchPeaks-v1>` is fixed to not to leave temporary hidden workspaces behind.

Python Fit Functions
####################

- A bug that makes it difficult to define and use attributes in python fit functions has been fixed.
- The usability of the fit functions has been improved, enabling users to construct and modify the functions as objects rather than strings 
  as described :ref:`here <FitFunctionsInPython>`.
