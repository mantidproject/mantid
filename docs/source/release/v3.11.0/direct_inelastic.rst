New features
------------

Algorithms
##########

- Data reduction workflow algorithms for ILL's TOF spectrometers IN4, IN5 and IN6 have been added to Mantid. A guide to the six new algorithms is provided :ref:`here <DirectILL>`.

Improvements
------------

Instrument definitions
######################

- The detector efficiency correction formulas for ILL's IN4, IN5 and IN6 spectrometers have been revised. IN4 has now separate formulas for the low and large angle detectors while the previously incorrect IN5 and IN6 formulas were fixed.
- New :math:`T_0`  formula for CNCS instrument

Algorithms
##########

- A bug was fixed in :ref:`DPDFReduction <algm-DPDFReduction>` to comply with the signature of one of the underlying C-functions.
- :ref:`algm-ComputeCalibrationCoefVan` uses :ref:`algm-IntegrateEPP` as its backend instead of manual summation when integrating the vanadium peak.
- :ref:`algm-DetectorEfficiencyCorUser` now accepts component-specific efficiency correction formulas.

Crystal Field
#############

- Added new fitting :ref:`function <func-CrystalFieldFunction>` that calculates crystal field spectra and physical properties for a multi-site case.
- Added CrystalFieldMultiSite, a Python wrapper for new CrystalFieldFunction.
