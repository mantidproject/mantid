Overview
--------

.. interface:: Tools
  :align: right
  :width: 350

The Indirect Tools interface contains useful tools that do not fit into the
other interfaces.

Transmission
------------

.. interface:: Tools
  :widget: tabTransmissionCalc

The Transmission tab is used to calculate the sample transmission for a given
sample on a given instrument configuration, this can then be used to determine
the sample shape and dimensions prior to an experiment.

Currently this is interface supports ISIS and SNS spectrometers.

Options
~~~~~~~

Instrument
  Instrument intending to be used.

Analyser
  Analyser bank intending to be used.

Reflection
  Reflection number of the planned instrument configuration.

Chemical Formula
  The chemical formula of the sample material, in the format used by the
  :ref:`SetSampleMaterial <algm-SetSampleMaterial>` algorithm.

Number Density
  The density of the sample in :math:`atoms/\mathrm{\AA{}}^3`.

Thickness
  The thickness of the sample in :math:`cm`.

LoadILL
-------

.. interface:: Tools
  :widget: tabLoadILL

The Load ILL tab is used to read data files generated by other facilities (i.e.
not ISIS or SNS). At present the only supported instruments are the ILL Indirect
Geometry spectrometers IN10, IN16 and IN13 (the latter is still a work in
progress).

The LoadILL tab operates on either *.asc* (raw data) or *.inx* (:math:`S(Q,
\omega)` reductions) files. To begin, start by selecting a relevant file using
the file browser. The interface will attempt to choose the relevant instrument
for you based on the file name. If the selected instrument currently being
displayed is not the one you desire it can be changed from selecting it in the
selection box. You may also select the relevant analyser and reflection to use.

Options
~~~~~~~

Run
  Run/reduction files to load.

Instrument
  Instrument used for experiment (set automatically based on filename if
  possible).

Analyser
  Analyser bank used for experiment.

Reflection
  Reflection number used for experiment.

Use Map & Map File
  Allows filtering the spectra using a map file.

Reject Zero
  If selected will remove any spectra that have no counts.

Verbose
  Enables outputting additional information to the Results Log.

Plot Result
  Allows each result to be plotted as either a spectrum plot or contour plot.

Save Result
  If enabled the loaded reductions will be saved as NeXus files in the default
  save directory.
