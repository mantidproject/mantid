Plotting Window
-----------------

The plotting window displays the data specified by the tabs within the interface. This data can be displayed as a single plot,
or as tiled plots, where each tile corresponds to either a Group/pair or a run.
By default this plot window is docked to the right-hand side of the main interface window, but can be undocked by
double-clicking on the title bar of the window.

The workspaces plotted in the figure depends on the tab which is currently being viewed:

- If the user is on the Home, Grouping or Phase table tabs the workspaces corresponding to the loaded runs and
  selected groups are plotted.
- If the user is on the fitting tab, the workspace displayed in the workspace selection box is plotted.
- If the user is on the sequential the plotted workspace is controlled through the table present in this tab.

Plotting Controls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The plotting can be controlled through serveral options:

**Plot type** Changes the plot type (e.g from asymmetry to counts).

**Tiled plotting** The 'tile plots by' checkbox enables tiled plotting, which can be performed over runs or Groups/pairs.

**Plot raw** Plot raw controls whether the raw or rebinned workspaces are plotted.

**Subplot Selector** Which axis to change the options for.

**x-Range** Sets the x-limits for the selected axes.

**Autoscale** Autoscales the y-axis based on the x-limits.

**y-Range**  Sets the y-limits for the selected axes.

**Errors** Whether to display errors for the workspaces plotted on the selected axes.
