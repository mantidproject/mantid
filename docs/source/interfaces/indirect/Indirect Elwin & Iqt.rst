Elwin
-----

Provides an interface for the :ref:`ElasticWindow <algm-ElasticWindow>`
algorithm, with the option of selecting the range to integrate over as well as
the background range. An on-screen plot is also provided.

For workspaces that have a sample log, or have a sample log file available in the
Mantid data search paths that contains the sample environment information the
ELF workspace can also be normalised to the lowest temperature run in the range
of input files.

Elwin Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Input File
  Specify a range of input files that are either reduced (*_red.nxs*) or
  :math:`S(Q, \omega)`.

Group Input
  The :ref:`ElasticWindowMultiple <algm-ElasticWindowMultiple>` algorithm is performed on the input files and returns a group
  workspace as the output. This option, if unchecked, will ungroup these output workspaces.

Load History
  If unchecked the input workspace will be loaded without it's history.

Integration Range
  The energy range over which to integrate the values.

Background Subtraction
  If checked a background will be calculated and subtracted from the raw data.

Background Range
  The energy range over which a background is calculated which is subtracted from
  the raw data.

Normalise to Lowest Temp
  If checked the raw files will be normalised to the run with the lowest
  temperature, to do this there must be a valid sample environment entry in the
  sample logs for each of the input files.

SE log name
  The name of the sample environment log entry in the input files sample logs
  (defaults to ‘sample’).

SE log value
  The value to be taken from the "SE log name" data series (defaults to the
  specified value in the instrument parameters file, and in the absence of such
  specification, defaults to "last value")

Preview File
  The workspace currently active in the preview plot.

Spectrum
  Changes the spectrum displayed in the preview plot.

Plot Current Preview
  Plots the currently selected preview plot in a separate external window

Run
  Runs the processing configured on the current tab.

Plot Spectra
  If enabled, it will plot the selected workspace indices in the selected output workspace.

Save Result
  Saves the result in the default save directory.

Elwin Example Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Elwin tab operates on ``_red`` and ``_sqw`` files. The files used in this workflow can
be produced using the run numbers 104371-104375 on the
:doc:`Indirect Data Reduction <Indirect Data Reduction>` interface in the ISIS Energy
Transfer tab. The instrument used to produce these files is OSIRIS, the analyser is graphite
and the reflection is 002.

1. Untick the **Load History** checkbox next to the file selector if you want to load your data
   without history.

2. Click **Browse** and select the files ``osiris104371_graphite002_red``,
   ``osiris104372_graphite002_red``, ``osiris104373_graphite002_red``, ``osiris104374_graphite002_red``
   and ``osiris104375_graphite002_red``. Load these files and they will be plotted in the mini-plot
   automatically.

3. The workspace and spectrum displayed in the mini-plot can be changed using the combobox and
   spinbox seen directly above the mini-plot.

4. You may opt to change the x range of the mini-plot by changing the **Integration Range**, or
   by sliding the blue lines seen on the mini-plot using the cursor. For the purpose of this
   demonstration, use the default x range.

5. Tick **Normalise to Lowest Temp**. This option will produce an extra workspace with end suffix
   _elt. However, for this to work the input workspaces must have a temperature. See the
   description above for more information.

6. Click **Plot Current Preview** if you want a larger plot of the mini-plot.

7. Click **Run** and wait for the interface to finish processing. This should generate four
   workspaces ending in _eq, _eq2, _elf and _elt.

8. In the **Output** section, select the workspace ending with _eq and then choose some workspace
   indices (e.g. 0-2,4). Click **Plot Spectra** to plot the spectrum from the selected workspace.

9. Choose a default save directory and then click **Save Result** to save the output workspaces.
   The workspace ending in _eq will be used in the :ref:`msdfit-example-workflow`.

I(Q, t)
-------

Given sample and resolution inputs, carries out a fit as per the theory detailed
in the :ref:`TransformToIqt <algm-TransformToIqt>` algorithm.

.. interface:: Data Analysis
  :width: 450
  :widget: tabIqt

I(Q, t) Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sample
  Either a reduced file (*_red.nxs*) or workspace (*_red*) or an :math:`S(Q,
  \omega)` file (*_sqw.nxs*) or workspace (*_sqw*).

Resolution
  Either a resolution file (_res.nxs) or workspace (_res) or an :math:`S(Q,
  \omega)` file (*_sqw.nxs*) or workspace (*_sqw*).

ELow, EHigh
  The rebinning range.

SampleBinning
  The number of neighbouring bins are summed.

Symmetric Energy Range
  Untick to allow an asymmetric energy range.

Spectrum
  Changes the spectrum displayed in the preview plot.

Plot Current Preview
  Plots the currently selected preview plot in a separate external window

Calculate Errors
  The calculation of errors using a Monte Carlo implementation can be skipped by unchecking
  this option.

Number Of Iterations
  The number of iterations to perform in the Monte Carlo routine for error calculation
  in I(Q,t).

Run
  Runs the processing configured on the current tab.

Plot Spectra
  If enabled, it will plot the selected workspace indices in the selected output workspace.

Plot Tiled
  Generates a tiled plot containing the selected workspace indices. This option is accessed via the down
  arrow on the **Plot Spectra** button.

Save Result
  Saves the result workspace in the default save directory.

.. _iqt-example-workflow:

I(Q, t) Example Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The I(Q, t) tab allows ``_red`` and ``_sqw`` for it's sample file, and allows ``_red``, ``_sqw`` and
``_res`` for the resolution file. The sample file used in this workflow can be produced using the run
number 26176 on the :doc:`Indirect Data Reduction <Indirect Data Reduction>` interface in the ISIS
Energy Transfer tab. The resolution file is created in the ISIS Calibration tab using the run number
26173. The instrument used to produce these files is IRIS, the analyser is graphite
and the reflection is 002.

1. Click **Browse** for the sample and select the file ``iris26176_graphite002_red``. Then click **Browse**
   for the resolution and select the file ``iris26173_graphite002_res``.

2. Change the **SampleBinning** variable to be 5. Changing this will calculate values for the **EWidth**,
   **SampleBins** and **ResolutionBins** variables automatically by using the
   :ref:`TransformToIqt <algm-TransformToIqt>` algorithm where the **BinReductionFactor** is given by the
   **SampleBinning** value. The **SampleBinning** value must be low enough for the **ResolutionBins** to be
   at least 5. A description of this option can be found in the :ref:`a-note-on-binning` section.

3. Untick **Calculate Errors** if you do not want to calculate the errors for the output workspace which
   ends with the suffix _iqt.

4. Click **Run** and wait for the interface to finish processing. This should generate a workspace ending
   with a suffix _iqt.

5. In the **Output** section, select some workspace indices (e.g.0-2,4,6) for a tiled plot and then click
   the down arrow on the **Plot Spectra** button before clicking **Plot Tiled**.

6. Choose a default save directory and then click **Save Result** to save the _iqt workspace.
   This workspace will be used in the :ref:`iqtfit-example-workflow`.

.. _a-note-on-binning:

A note on Binning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The bin width is determined from the energy range and the sample binning factor. The number of bins is automatically
calculated based on the **SampleBinning** specified. The width is determined from the width of the range divided
by the number of bins.

The following binning parameters cannot be modified by the user and are instead automatically calculated through
the :ref:`TransformToIqt <algm-TransformToIqt>` algorithm once a valid resolution file has been loaded. The calculated
binning parameters are displayed alongside the binning options:

EWidth
  The calculated bin width.

SampleBins
  The number of bins in the sample after rebinning.

ResolutionBins
  The number of bins in the resolution after rebinning. Typically this should be at
  least 5 and a warning will be shown if it is less.
