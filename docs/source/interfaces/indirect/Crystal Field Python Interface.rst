Crystal Field Python Interface
==============================

  :local:

The python facilities for Crystal Field calculations are available in Mantid from module `CrystalField`.
The module provides two main classes: `CrystalField` defines various properties of a crystal field and
`CrystalFieldFit` manages the fitting process.

Theoretical background can be found in the :ref:`concept page <Crystal Field Theory>`
and worked examples in the :ref:`examples page <Crystal_Field_Examples>`.


Setting up crystal field parameters
-----------------------------------

A crystal field computation starts with creating an instance of the `CrystalField` class. The constructor
has two mandatory arguments: `Ion` - the symbolic name of the ion, and `Symmetry` - the name of the point symmetry
group of the field. The rest of the parameters are optional.

Possible values for the `Ion` argument are::

 Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb

These are the trivalent rare-earth ions. For other rare earth ions, use the equivalent trivalent ion based on
the number of *f*-electrons in the outer shell (e.g. for Pr\ :sup:`4+` (4\ *f*\ :sup:`1`) use `Ce`).
The rare earth ions sets the correct value of the Lande g-factor. In addition, a pure spin ion with arbitrary
(but half-integral) *S* (or *J*) values are also supported using the syntax: `Ion=S<n>` where `<n>` is an integer
or half-integer value, e.g. `Ion=S2` or `Ion=S1.5`. In these cases, the g-factor is set to *g*\ :sub:`J` = 2.
The prefix letter can also be `J` instead of `S`, and lower case letters are also supported. (e.g. `Ion=j1`,
`Ion=s2.5` and `Ion=J0.5` are all valid).

Allowed values for `Symmetry` are::

  C1, Ci, C2, Cs, C2h, C2v, D2, D2h, C4, S4, C4h, D4, C4v, D2d, D4h, C3,
  S6, D3, C3v, D3d, C6, C3h, C6h, D6, C6v, D3h, D6h, T, Td, Th, O, Oh

The minimum code to create a crystal field object is::

  from CrystalField import CrystalField
  cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v')

Names of the crystal field parameters have the form `Bnn` and `IBnn` where `nn` are two digits between 0 and 6.
`Bnn` is the real and `IBnn` is the imaginary part of a complex parameter. If a parameter isn't set explicitly
its default value is 0. To set a parameter pass it to the `CrystalField` constructor as a keyword argument, e.g.::

  cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770)

An alternative way to set a parameter is to use the square brackets with a `CrystalField` object::

  cf['B40'] = -0.031

Which can also be used to query the value of a parameter::

  b = cf['B40']


Calculating the Eigensystem
---------------------------

The `CrystalField` class has methods to calculate the Hamiltonian and its eigensystem::

  # Calculate and return the Hamiltonian matrix as a 2D numpy array.
  h = cf.getHamiltonian()

  # Calculate and return the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian as a 1D numpy array.
  e = cf.getEigenvalues()

  # Calculate and return the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian as a 2D numpy array.
  w = cf.getEigenvectors()

It is efficient to call the above methods multiple times as all the outputs are cached and the calculations are repeated
only after a parameter changes.


Calculating a Spectrum
----------------------

To calculate a spectrum `CrystalField` needs to know the sample temperature and the shape of the peaks.

The temperature can be set either via a keyword argument `Temperature` of the constructor or using the
`Temperature` property::

  # Using the keyword argument
  cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, Temperature=44)

  # Using the property
  cf.Temperature = 44

Knowing the temperature allows us to calculate a peak list: a list of transition energies and intensities.::

  print cf.getPeakList()

Which produces the output::

 [[  0.00000000e+00   2.44006198e+01   4.24977124e+01   1.80970926e+01 -2.44006198e+01]
  [  2.16711565e+02   8.83098530e+01   5.04430056e+00   1.71153708e-01  1.41609425e-01]]

The first row are the energies (in meV) and the second row are the integrated intensities (in milibarn per steradian).

The number of peaks that the function returns is controlled by two tolerance parameters: `ToleranceEnergy` and
`ToleranceIntensity`. If a peak has an intensity below the value of `ToleranceIntensity` the peak is ignored.
It two peaks have a difference in the energies smaller than `ToleranceEnergy` they are combined into a single peak.

If we set `ToleranceIntensity` of the above crystal field object to 1 mb/sr we'll have only three peaks in the list::

  cf.ToleranceIntensity = 1
  print cf.getPeakList()

The new output::

 [[   0.           24.40061976   42.49771237]
  [ 216.71156467   88.30985303    5.04430056]]

To calculate a spectrum we need to define the shape of each peak (peak profile function) and its default width (`FWHM`).
The width can be set either via a keyword argument or a property with name `FWHM`. If the peak shape isn't set the default
of `Lorentzian` is assumed. To set a different shape use the `PeakShape` property::

  cf.PeakShape = 'Gaussian'
  cf.FWHM = 0.9

The values of `PeakShape` are expected to be names of Mantid peak fit functions. At the moment only `Lorentzian` and
`Gaussian` can be used.

After the peak shape is defined a spectrum can be calculated::

  sp = cf.getSpectrum()

The output is a tuple of two 1d numpy arrays (x, y) that can be used with `matplotlib` to plot::

  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.plot(*sp)
  plt.show()

.. image:: /images/CrystalFieldSpectrum1.png
   :height: 300

It is possible to change parameters of individual peaks separately. Note though that only the shape parameters can be changed,
the peak centre and the integrated intensity are defined by the crystal field parameters. To change the width of a peak
use the following syntax::

  # If the peak shape is Gaussian
  cf.peaks.param[1]['Sigma'] = 2.0
  cf.peaks.param[2]['Sigma'] = 0.01

  # If the peak shape is Lorentzian
  cf.peaks.param[1]['FWHM'] = 2.0
  cf.peaks.param[2]['FWHM'] = 0.01

The three peaks now have all different widths. The first peak (index 0) keeps the default value.

.. image:: /images/CrystalFieldSpectrum2.png
   :height: 300

If called without arguments `getSpectrum()` determines automatically the range and number of the `x`-points. To have more control
of how the spectrum is calculated a list (or numpy array) of x-values can be provided as a first argument to `getSpectrum`.
Alternatively, the x-values can be taken from a workspace::

  # Use a list for x-values
  x = [0, 1, 2, 3, ...]
  sp = cf.getSpectrum(x)

  # Use the first spectrum of a workspace
  sp = cf.getSpectrum(ws)

  # Use the i-th spectrum of a workspace
  sp = cf.getSpectrum(ws, i)


Plotting in MantidPlot
----------------------

To plot a spectrum using MantidPlot's graphing facilities `CrystalField` has method `plot`. It has the same arguments as `getSpectrum`
and opens a window with a plot, e.g.::

  cf.plot()

In addition to plotting, the `plot` method creates a workspace named `CrystalField_<Ion>` with the plot data. Subsequent calls to `plot`
for the same `CrystalField` object will use the same plot window as created by the first call unless this window has been closed in the
mean time.


Adding a Background
-------------------

A background has two components: a peak and a general background function. Set a background using the `background` property::

    from CrystalField import CrystalField, CrystalFieldFit, Background, Function
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544,
                      Temperature=44.0, FWHM=1.1)
    cf.background = Background(peak=Function('Gaussian', Height=10, Sigma=1),
                               background=Function('LinearBackground', A0=1.0, A1=0.01))

Here is an example of how to access the parameters of the background::

    h = cf.background.peak.param['Height']
    a1 = cf.background.background.param['A1']


Setting Ties and Constraints
----------------------------

Setting ties and constraints are done by calling the `ties` and `constraints` methods of the `CrystalField` class or its components.
The `Bnn` parameters are tied by the `CrystalField` class directly specifying the tied parameter as a keyword argument::

  cf.ties(B20=1.0, B40='B20/2')

The constraints are passed as strings containing expressions::

  cf.constraints('1 < B22 <= 2', 'B22 < 4')

For the parameters of the background the syntax is the same but the methods are called on the `background` property::

    cf.background.peak.ties(Height=10.1)
    cf.background.peak.constraints('Sigma > 0')
    cf.background.background.ties(A0=0.1)
    cf.background.background.constraints('A1 > 0')

The names of the peak parameters both in ties and constraints must include the index of the peak to which they belong. Here we follow
the naming convention of the :ref:`func-CompositeFunction`: f<n>.<name>, where <n> stands for an integer index staring at 0 and <name>
is the name of the parameter. For example, `f1.Sigma`, `f3.FWHM`. Because names now contain the period symbol '.' keyword arguments
cannot be used. Instead we must pass a dictionary containing ties. The keys are parameter names and the values are the ties::

    cf.peaks.ties({'f2.FWHM': '2*f1.FWHM', 'f3.FWHM': '2*f2.FWHM'})

Constraints are a list of strings::

    cf.peaks.constraints('f0.FWHM < 2.2', 'f1.FWHM >= 0.1')

If a parameter of all peaks needs to be tied/constrained with the same expression then the following shortcut methods can be used::

    cf.peaks.tieAll('Sigma=0.1', 3)
    cf.peaks.constrainAll('0 < Sigma < 0.1', 4)

where the first argument is the general formula of the tie/constraint and the second is the number of peaks to apply to.
There is also a version for a range of peak indices::

    cf.peaks.tieAll('Sigma=f0.Sigma', 1, 3)

which is equivalent to::

    cf.peaks.ties({'f1.Sigma': 'f0.Sigma', 'f2.Sigma': 'f0.Sigma', 'f3.Sigma': 'f0.Sigma'})


Setting Resolution Model
------------------------

A resolution model is a way to constrain the widths of the peaks to realistic numbers which agree with a measured or
calculated instrument resolution function. A model is a function that returns a FWHM for a peak centre. The Crystal
Field python interface defines the helper class `ResolutionModel` to help define and set resolution models.

To construct an instance of `ResolutionModel` one needs to provide up to four input parameters. The first parameter, `model`, is
mandatory and can be either of:

1. A tuple containing two arrays (lists) of real numbers which will be interpreted as tabulated values of the model function.
   The first element of the tuple is a list of increasing values for peak centres, and the second element is a list of corresponding
   widths. Values between the tabulated peak positions will be linearly interpolated.

2. A python function that takes a :class:`numpy.ndarray` of peak positions and returns a numpy array of widths.

If the model is a tuple of two arrays then no additional parameters are required. If it's a function then the rest of the parameters define how to tabulate this
function. `xstart` and `xend` define the interval of interpolation which must include all fitted peaks. The last argument is `accuracy` that defaults to
:math:`10^{-4}` and defines an approximate desired accuracy of the approximation. The interval will be split until the largest error of the interpolation
is smaller than `accuracy`. Note that subdivision cannot go on to infinity as the number of points is limited by the class member `ResolutionModel.max_model_size`.

Example of setting a resolution model using a tuple of two arrays::

    from CrystalField import CrystalField, ResolutionModel
    rm = ResolutionModel(([1, 2, 3, ...., 100], [0.1, 0.3, 0.35, ..., 2.1]))
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, ..., Temperature=44.0, ResolutionModel=rm)

Or using an arbitrary function `my_func`::

    def my_func(en):
        return (25-en)**(1.5) / 200 + 0.1

    rm = ResolutionModel(my_func, xstart=0.0, xend=24.0, accuracy=0.01)
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, ..., Temperature=44.0, ResolutionModel=rm)

Finally, the :ref:`PyChop` interface may be used to generate the resolution function for a particular spectrometer::

    from PyChop import PyChop2
    marires = PyChop2('MARI')
    marires.setChopper('S')
    marires.setFrequency(250)
    marires.setEi(30)
    rm = ResolutionModel(marires.getResolution, xstart=0.0, xend=29.0, accuracy=0.01)
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, ..., Temperature=44.0, ResolutionModel=rm)

When a resolution model is set, the peak width will be constrained to have a value close to the model. The degree of deviation is controlled by the
`FWHMVariation` parameter. It has the default of 0.1 and is the maximum difference from the value given by the resolution model a width can have.
If set to 0 the widths will be fixed to their calculated values (depending on the instant values of their peak centres). For example::

    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, ..., Temperature=44.0, ResolutionModel=rm, FWHMVariation=0.1)

will allow the peak widths to vary between :math:`\Delta(E)-0.1` and :math:`\Delta(E)+0.1` where :math:`\Delta(E)` is the value of the
resolution model at the peak position :math:`E`.



Defining Multiple Spectra
-------------------------

A `CrystalField` object can be configured to work with multiple spectra. In this case some many of the object's properties
become lists. Here is an example of defining a `CrystalField` object with two spectra::

    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544,
                      Temperature=[44.0, 50], FWHM=[1.1, 0.9])
    cf.PeakShape = 'Lorentzian'
    cf.peaks[0].param[0]['FWHM'] = 1.11
    cf.peaks[1].param[1]['FWHM'] = 1.12
    cf.background = Background(peak=Function('Gaussian', Height=10, Sigma=0.3),
                               background=Function('FlatBackground', A0=1.0))
    cf.background[1].peak.param['Sigma'] = 0.8
    cf.background[1].background.param['A0'] = 1.1

Note how `Temperature`, `FWHM`, `peaks` and `background` become lists. They must have the same size. Ties and constraints similarly
change::

    # The B parameters are common for all spectra - syntax doesn't change
    cf.ties(B20=1.0, B40='B20/2')
    cf.constraints('1 < B22 <= 2', 'B22 < 4')

    # Backgrounds and peaks are different for different spectra - must be indexed
    cf.background[0].peak.ties(Height=10.1)
    cf.background[0].peak.constraints('Sigma > 0.1')
    cf.background[1].peak.ties(Height=20.2)
    cf.background[1].peak.constraints('Sigma > 0.2')
    cf.peaks[1].tieAll('FWHM=2*f1.FWHM', 2, 5)
    cf.peaks[0].constrainAll('FWHM < 2.2', 1, 4)

The resolution model also needs to be initialised from a list::

    x0, y0, x1, y1 = [ ... ], [ ... ], [ ... ], [ ... ]
    rm = ResolutionModel([(x0, y0), (x1, y1)])

    # or

    rm = ResolutionModel([func0, func1], 0, 100, accuracy = 0.01)
    cf.ResolutionModel = rm

To calculate a spectrum call the same method `getSpectrum` but pass the spectrum index as its first parameter::

    # Calculate second spectrum, use the generated x-values
    sp = cf.getSpectrum(1)

    # Calculate third spectrum, use a list for x-values
    x = [0, 1, 2, 3, ...]
    sp = cf.getSpectrum(2, x)

    # Calculate second spectrum, use the first spectrum of a workspace
    sp = cf.getSpectrum(1, ws)

    # Calculate first spectrum, use the i-th spectrum of a workspace
    sp = cf.getSpectrum(0, ws, i)

Note that the attributes `Temperature`, `FWHM`, `peaks` and `background` may be set separately from the constructor, e.g.::

    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544)
    cf.Temperature = [5, 50]

However, each time that `Temperature` is set, if it defines a different number of spectra from the previous value
(e.g. if `Temperature` was initially empty or `None` and is then defined as in the example above, or if `Temperature`
was initially a scalar value but is then redefined to be a list or vice versa), then all `Ties`, `Constraints`,
`FWHM` and `peaks` parameters are cleared. Any crystal field parameters previously defined will be retained, however.


Fitting
-------

To fit the crystal field and peak parameters first create a `CrystalField` object as described above. Then create an
instance (object) of the `CrystalFieldFit` class::

    from CrystalField import CrystalFieldFit
    # In case of a single spectrum (ws is a workspace)
    fit = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)

    # Or for multiple spectra
    fit = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=[ws1, ws2])

Then call `fit()` method::

    fit.fit()

After fitting finishes the `CrystalField` object updates automatically and contains new fitted parameter values.


Multiple Ions
-------------

If there are multiple ions you can define `CrystalField` objects for each ion separately then add them together to
create a CrystalFieldMultiSite object::

    params = {'B20': 0.377, 'B22': 3.9, 'B40': -0.03, 'B42': -0.116, 'B44': -0.125,
              'Temperature': [44.0, 50], 'FWHM': [1.1, 0.9]}
    cf1 = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', **params)
    cf2 = CrystalField('Pr', 'C2v', **params)
    cfms = cf1 + cf2

The expression that combines the `CrystalField` objects also defines the contributions of each site into the overall intensity.
The higher the coefficient of the object in the expression the higher its relative contribution. For example::

    cf = 2*cf1 + cf2

means that the intensity of `cf1` should be twice that of `cf2`.

Alternatively, you can create a `CrystalFieldMultiSite` object directly. This takes Ions, Symmetries, Temperatures and peak widths as lists::

    from CrystalField import CrystalFieldMultiSite
    cfms = CrystalFieldMultiSite(Ions=['Ce', 'Pr'], Symmetries=['C2v', 'C2v'], Temperatures=[44.0], FWHMs=[1.1])

Note that `Temperature` and `FWHM` (without plural) can also be used in place of the equivalent plural parameters.
To access parameters of a CrystalFieldMultiSite object, prefix them with the ion index::

    cfms['ion0.B40'] = -0.031
    cfms['ion1.B20'] = 0.37737
    b = cfms['ion0.B22']


Parameters can be set when creating the object by passing in a dictionary using the `parameters` keyword::

    cfms = CrystalFieldMultiSite(Ions=['Ce', 'Pr'], Symmetries=['C2v', 'C2v'], Temperatures=[44.0], FWHMs=[1.1],
                                 parameters={'ion0.B20': 0.37737, 'ion0.B22': 3.9770, 'ion1.B40':-0.031787,
                                             'ion1.B42':-0.11611, 'ion1.B44':-0.12544})

A background can also be set this way, or using `cfms.background.` It can be passed as a string, a Function object(s), or a
CompositeFunction object::

    cfms = CrystalFieldMultiSite(Ions='Ce', Symmetries='C2v', Temperatures=[20], FWHMs=[1.0],
                              Background='name=Gaussian,Height=0,PeakCentre=1,Sigma=0;name=LinearBackground,A0=0,A1=0')

    cfms = CrystalFieldMultiSite(Ions=['Ce'], Symmetries=['C2v'], Temperatures=[50], FWHMs=[0.9],
                                   Background=LinearBackground(A0=1.0), BackgroundPeak=Gaussian(Height=10, Sigma=0.3))

    cfms = CrystalFieldMultiSite(Ions='Ce', Symmetries='C2v', Temperatures=[20], FWHMs=[1.0],
                                   Background= Gaussian(PeakCentre=1) + LinearBackground())

Ties and constraints are set similarly to `CrystalField` objects. `f` prefixes have been changed to be more descriptive::

    cfms = CrystalFieldMultiSite(Ions=['Ce','Pr'], Symmetries=['C2v', 'C2v'], Temperatures=[44, 50], FWHMs=[1.1, 0.9],
                                   Background=FlatBackground(), BackgroundPeak=Gaussian(Height=10, Sigma=0.3),
                                   parameters={'ion0.B20': 0.37737, 'ion0.B22': 3.9770, 'ion1.B40':-0.031787,
                                               'ion1.B42':-0.11611, 'ion1.B44':-0.12544})
    cfms.ties({'sp0.bg.f0.Height': 10.1})
    cfms.constraints('sp0.bg.f0.Sigma > 0.1')
    cfms.constraints('ion0.sp0.pk1.FWHM < 2.2')
    cfms.ties({'ion0.sp1.pk2.FWHM': '2*ion0.sp1.pk1.FWHM', 'ion1.sp1.pk3.FWHM': '2*ion1.sp1.pk2.FWHM'})

Parameters which are not allowed by the specified symmetry will be fixed to be zero, but unlike for the single-site case,
all other parameters are assumed to be free (in the single-site case, parameters which are unset are assumed to be fixed
to be zero). For the multi-site case, parameters must be fixed explicitly. For example::

    params = {'ion0.B20': 0.37737, 'ion0.B22': 3.9770, 'ion1.B40':-0.031787, 'ion1.B42':-0.11611, 'ion1.B44':-0.12544}
    cf = CrystalFieldMultiSite(Ions=['Ce', 'Pr'], Symmetries=['C2v', 'C2v'], Temperatures=[44.0, 50.0],
                                    FWHMs=[1.0, 1.0], ToleranceIntensity=6.0, ToleranceEnergy=1.0,  FixAllPeaks=True,
                                   parameters=params)

    cf.fix('ion0.BmolX', 'ion0.BmolY', 'ion0.BmolZ', 'ion0.BextX', 'ion0.BextY', 'ion0.BextZ', 'ion0.B40',
           'ion0.B42', 'ion0.B44', 'ion0.B60', 'ion0.B62', 'ion0.B64', 'ion0.B66', 'ion0.IntensityScaling',
           'ion1.BmolX', 'ion1.BmolY', 'ion1.BmolZ', 'ion1.BextX', 'ion1.BextY', 'ion1.BextZ', 'ion1.B40',
           'ion1.B42', 'ion1.B44', 'ion1.B60', 'ion1.B62', 'ion1.B64', 'ion1.B66', 'ion1.IntensityScaling',
           'sp0.IntensityScaling', 'sp1.IntensityScaling')

    chi2 = CalculateChiSquared(str(cf.function), InputWorkspace=ws1, InputWorkspace_1=ws2)[1]

    fit = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=[ws1, ws2], MaxIterations=10)
    fit.fit()

Calculating a spectrum can be done with `CrystalFieldMultiSite` in the same way as a `CrystalField` object.

CrystalFieldMultiSite can also be used in the single-site case to use the `CrystalFieldFunction` fitting function. It
can be used like a `CrystalField` object in this way, although `Temperatures` and `FWHMs` must still be passed as lists::

    cfms = CrystalFieldMultiSite(Ions='Ce', Symmetries='C2', Temperatures=[25], FWHMs=[1.0], PeakShape='Gaussian',
                                     BmolX=1.0, B40=-0.02)



Finding Initial Parameters
--------------------------

Using a Monte Carlo estimation method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the initial values of the fitting parameters are not known they can be estimated using `estimate_parameters()` method.
It randomly searches the parameter space in a given region such that the calculated spectra are as close to the
fit data as possible. The method uses :ref:`EstimateFitParameters <algm-EstimateFitParameters>` internally. See
algorithm's description for the available properties.
Here is an example of a fit with initial estimation::

Using the point charge model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, the *Point Charge Model* may be used to calculate the crystal field parameters. In this case, the
crystal field interaction is assumed to be purely electrostatic. At an infinite distance away from an ion, or
analogously, at a nonzero distance from an ion of infinitesimal extend (a *point charge*), the charge in free space
is zero, so Gauss's law becomes :math:`\nabla^2 V = 0` which is Laplace's equation. The solution of this is a
*multipole expansion*, a sum of spherical harmonic functions:
:math:`V(r,\theta\phi) = \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} \sum_{m=-l}^l R_l(r) Y_l^m(\theta,\phi)`. In the limit of infinite
:math:`r`, :math:`R_l(r) = B / r^{l+1}`. The radial term is the crystal field parameters, and the angular term
(spherical harmonics in this case) are the crystal field operators.

One should now note that the quantities noted above are generally complex. In order to have real valued parameters,
Stevens chose to use the *tesseral harmonics* :math:`Z_l^m(\theta,\phi)` instead of the spherical harmonics for the
angular part. These functions are simply the hermitian combinations of spherical harmonics of the same rank :math:`l`
and opposite signed order :math:`m`. (An alternative formulation by Wybourne uses the original spherical harmonics)

In Mantid we use the Stevens convention, as common in the neutron scattering literature. The user should note that
the convention amongst optical spectroscopists is that of Wybourne.

A derivation of the point charge energy can be found in many text books (e.g.
`Morrison <http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-93376-9_12>`_), but will not be detailed here, where only the final
result is given:

.. math::
   B_l^m = \frac{4\pi}{2l+1} \frac{| e|^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}
           \sum_i \frac{q_i}{r_i^{l+1}} a_0^l \langle r^l \rangle Z_l^m(\theta_i,\phi_i)

where :math:`q_i`, :math:`r_i`, :math:`\theta_i` and :math:`\phi_i` are the charge (in units of the elemental
charge :math:`|e|`) and relative polar coordinates of the :math:`i^{\mathrm{th}}` point charge from the magnetic ion;
:math:`a_0` is the Bohr radius, :math:`\langle r^l \rangle` is the :math:`l^{\mathrm{th}}` order expectation value
of the radial wavefunction of the magnetic ion and :math:`\epsilon_0` is the permitivity of free space (note this
equation is in SI units; many older texts use cgs units, but this does not matter because the value is eventually
converted to energy units of **meV**, rather than Joules or ergs).

In order to calculate the point charge model crystal field parameters a set of charged ligands around the magnetic
ion has to be given. This may be done either directly, as a list of 4-element lists ``[charge, pos_x, pos_y, pos_z]``::

    from CrystalField import PointCharge
    axial_pc_model = PointCharge([[-2, 0, 0, -4], [-2, 0, 0, 4]], 'Nd')
    axial_blm = axial_pc_model.calculate()
    print(axial_blm)

which represents a simple axial crystal field with charges at :math:`\pm 4\mathrm{\AA}` away from a Nd ion in the
*z*-direction.

Alternatively, the set of ligands may be calculated from a crystal structure and a maximum distance. For example,
for a cubic crystal field in the perovskite structure::

    from CrystalField import PointCharge
    from mantid.geometry import CrystalStructure
    perovskite_structure = CrystalStructure('4 4 4 90 90 90', 'P m -3 m', 'Ce 0 0 0 1 0; Al 0.5 0.5 0.5 1 0; O 0.5 0.5 0 1 0')
    cubic_pc_model = PointCharge(perovskite_structure, 'Ce', Charges={'Ce':3, 'Al':3, 'O':-2}, MaxDistance=7.5)

The syntax for the ``CrystalStructure`` object is given in the :ref:`Crystal Structure concept page <Crystal structure and reflections>`.
Instead of the maximum distance, ``MaxDistance``, in Angstrom, the maximum *n*\ :sup:`th` neighbour can be specified with::

    cubic_pc_model = PointCharge(perovskite_structure, 'Ce', Charges={'Ce':3, 'Al':3, 'O':-2}, Neighbour=2)

note that this might result in a slightly slower calculation, because internally, a maximum distance much greater
the *n*\ :sup:`th` neighbour is set and then all neighbours up to *n* are found within this distance.

If a workspace with a defined crystal structure exists, it can be used instead of the ``CrystalStructure`` object.
Other inputs remain the same. Finally, a CIF file can be given directly::

    cif_pc_model = PointCharge('somecompound.cif')

This uses :ref:`LoadCIF <algm-LoadCIF>` to parse the input CIF file. Note that ``LoadCIF`` changes the atom labels,
so you should use the ``getIons()`` method to get the actual atom labels which ``PointCharge`` uses. E.g. using
`this cif file <http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/download.php?id=19658.cif&down=cif>`_::

    cif_pc_model = PointCharge('AMS_DATA.cif')
    print(cif_pc_model.getIons())

gives::

    {'O1': [0.125, 0.125, 0.375],
     'O2': [0.125, 0.375, 0.375],
     'Sm1': [0.25, 0.25, 0.25],
     'Sm2': [0.021, 0.0, 0.25],
     'Sm3': [0.542, 0.0, 0.25]}

You can then define the charges for each site, the magnetic ion and the maximum distance, and calculate::

    cif_pc_model.Charges = {'O1':-2, 'O2':-2, 'Sm1':3, 'Sm2':3, 'Sm3':3}
    cif_pc_model.IonLabel = 'Sm2'
    cif_pc_model.Neighbour = 1
    cif_blm = cif_pc_model.calculate()
    print(cif_blm)

Note that only the magnetic structure (as a ``CrystalStructure`` object, CIF file name or workspace) is needed
to construct a ``PointCharge`` object. However, the calculations will return an error unless both ``IonLabel``
and ``Charges`` are defined. By default a value of 5 :math:`\mathrm{\AA}` for ``MaxDistance`` is used if neither
``MaxDistance`` nor ``Neighbour`` is defined. Whichever of ``MaxDistance`` or ``Neighbour`` is defined last
takes precedent, and if both are defined in the constructor, e.g.::

    bad_pc_model = PointCharge('AMS_DATA.cif', MaxDistance=7.5, Neighbour=2)

then the value for ``MaxDistance`` will be used regardless of where it appears in the keyword list.

For ``Charges``, instead of listing the charges of each site, you can just give the charge for each element, e.g.::

    cif_pc_model.Charges = {'O':-2, 'Sm':3}
    cif_blm = cif_pc_model.calculate()

The result of the ``calculate()`` method can be put directly into a ``CrystalField`` object and used either
to calculate a spectrum or as the starting parameters in a fit::

    cf = CrystalField('Sm', 'C2', Temperature=5, FWHM=10, **cif_pc_model.calculate())
    plot(*cf.getSpectrum())
    fit = CrystalFieldFit(cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    fit.fit()

Finally, note that the calculated crystal field parameters are defined with the quantisation axis along the *z* direction
in the Busing-Levy convention (that is, it is perpendicular to the *a*-*b* plane). This means that if the particular
magnetic ion lies on a higher symmetry site but the highest symmetry rotation axis is not along *z* (for example, the A
or B site in the Pyrochlore lattice, which has a 3-fold axis along [111], whilst *z* is parallel to *c*), then the
parameters may appear to have a low symmetry (e.g. more *m* terms are nonzero). You then need to rotate the parameters
if you want it quantised along the high symmetry direction.


Calculating Physical Properties
-------------------------------

In addition to the inelastic neutron spectrum, various physical properties arising from the crystal field interaction
can be calculated. These include the crystal field contribution to the magnetic heat capacity, the magnetic
susceptibility, and magnetisation. The calculated values can be invoked using the `getHeatCapacity()`,
`getSusceptibility()` and `getMagneticMoment()` methods.

To calculate the heat capacity use::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, Temperature=44.0)
    Cv = cf.getHeatCapacity()       # Calculates Cv(T) for 1<T<300K in 1K steps  (default)
    plt.plot(*Cv)                   # Returns a tuple of (x, y) values

    T = np.arange(1,900,5)
    Cv = cf.getHeatCapacity(T)      # Calculates Cv(T) for specified values of T (1 to 900K in 5K steps here)
    plt.plot(T, Cv[1])

    # Temperatures from a single spectrum workspace
    ws = CreateWorkspace(T, T, T)
    Cv = cf.getHeatCapacity(ws)     # Use the x-values of a workspace as the temperatures
    ws_calc = CreateWorkspace(*Cv)
    plot(ws_calc, 0)                # Creates workspace from data and plots it (plots the first spectrum, index 0)

    # Temperatures from a multi-spectrum workspace
    ws = CreateWorkspace(T, T, T, NSpec=2)
    Cv = cf.getHeatCapacity(ws, 1)  # Uses the second spectrum's x-values for T (e.g. 450<T<900)
    plot(*Cv)

All the physical properties methods returns a tuple of `(x, y)` values. The heat capacity is calculated in
Jmol\ :sup:`-1`\ K\ :sup:`-1`\ .
The theory is described in :ref:`CrystalFieldHeatCapacity <func-CrystalFieldHeatCapacity>`.

The molar susceptibility is calculated using Van Vleck's formula, and requires in addition knowledge of the applied
field direction (default is `[0, 0, 1]` where the field is along the crystal field quantisation direction)::

    chi_v = cf.getSusceptibility(T, Hdir=[1, 1, 1])

The field direction is a Cartesian vector with coordinates defined with the `z`-axis parallel to the quantisation
direction of the crystal field parameters (usually taken to be the highest symmetry rotation axis). To calculate
for a powder averaged field direction use::

    chi_v_powder = cf.getSusceptibility(T, Hdir='powder')

The powder averaging is done by taking the mean of the susceptibility (or magnetisation) along the :math:`x`,
:math:`y` and :math:`z` directions (e.g. :math:`\chi^{\mathrm{pow}} = (\chi^x + \chi^y + \chi^z)/3`).

Note that the function calculates the *molar* magnetic susceptibility, and by default outputs it in *cgs* units
(cm\ :sup:`3`/mol or emu/mol). To obtain the result in SI units (m\ :sup:`3`/mol)
use::

    chi_v_cgs = cf.getSusceptibility(T, Hdir=[1, 1, 0], Unit='SI')

In addition, "atomic" units (:math:`\mu_B/\mathrm{T}/\mathrm{ion}`) can also be obtained using::

    chi_v_bohr = cf.getSusceptibility(T, Unit='bohr')

The theory is described in the :ref:`CrystalFieldSusceptibility <func-CrystalFieldSusceptibility>` function page.

The magnetic moment is calculated by adding a Zeeman interaction to the crystal field Hamiltonian and diagonalising
the combined matrix, from which the expectation of the magnetic moment operator is calculated. The moment can
be calculated as a function of temperature or applied field magnitude::

    moment_t = cf.getMagneticMoment(Temperature=T, Hdir=[1, 1, 1], Hmag=0.1) # Calcs M(T) with at 0.1T field||[111]
    H = np.linspace(0, 30, 121)
    moment_h = cf.getMagneticMoment(Hmag=H, Hdir='powder', Temperature=10)   # Calcs M(H) at 10K for powder sample

By default, the magnetisation is calculated in atomic units of bohr magnetons per magnetic ion. Alternatively, the
SI or cgs molar magnetic moments can be calculated::

    moment_SI = cf.getMagneticMoment(H, [1, 1, 1], Unit='SI')         # M(H) in Am^2/mol at 1K for H||[111]
    moment_cgs = cf.getMagneticMoment(100, Temperature=T, Unit='cgs') # M(T) in emu/mol in a field of 100G || [001]

Please note that if cgs units are used, then the magnetic field must be specified in *Gauss* rather than *Tesla*
(1T == 10000G). Note also that the cgs unit "emu/mol" in this case is "erg/Gauss/mol" quantifying a molar magnetic
moment.

Finally, please note that the calculation result is the molar magnetic moment. Thus to get the magnetisation, you
should divide this by the molar volume of the material.
By default, the calculation temperature is 1K, and the applied magnetic field is 1T along [001]. For further details
and a description of the theory, see the :ref:`CrystalFieldMagnetisation <func-CrystalFieldMagnetisation>` and
:ref:`CrystalFieldMoment <func-CrystalFieldMoment>` pages.

Fitting Physical Properties
---------------------------

Instead of fitting the inelastic neutron spectrum, the physical properties can be fitted using a similar interface
to that described above. The main difference is that some experimental setup information has to be given - especially
for the susceptibility and magnetisation. This is done by specifying an instance of the `PhysicalProperties` helper
class as the `PhysicalProperty` attribute of `CrystalField`, either as a keyword argument in the constructor::

    from CrystalField import CrystalField, CrystalFieldFit, PhysicalProperties
    # Fits a heat capacity dataset - you must have subtracted the phonon contribution by some method already
    # and the data must be in J/mol/K.
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544,
                      PhysicalProperty=PhysicalProperties('Cv'))
    fitcv = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    fitcv.fit()

or separately after construction::

    params = {'B20':0.37737, 'B22':3.9770, 'B40':-0.031787, 'B42':-0.11611, 'B44':-0.12544}
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', **params)
    cf.PhysicalProperty = PhysicalProperties('Cv')
    fitcv = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    fitcv.fit()

    # Fits a susceptibility dataset. Data is the volume susceptibility in SI units
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', **params)
    cf.PhysicalProperty = PhysicalProperties('susc', Hdir='powder', Unit='SI')
    fit_chi = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    fit_chi.fit()

    # Fits a magnetisation dataset. Data is in emu/mol, and was measured at 5K with the field || [111].
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', **params)
    cf.PhysicalProperty = PhysicalProperties('M(H)', Temperature=5, Hdir=[1, 1, 1], Unit='cgs')
    fit_mag = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    fit_mag.fit()

    # Fits a magnetisation vs temperature dataset. Data is in Am^2/mol, measured with a 0.1T field || [110]
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', **params)
    cf.PhysicalProperty = PhysicalProperties('M(T)', Hmag=0.1, Hdir=[1, 1, 0], Unit='SI')
    fit_moment = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=ws)
    fit_moment.fit()

Unfortunately only 1D datasets can be fitted (e.g. M(H, T) cannot be fitted as a simultaneous function of field and
temperature). Also, note that setting the `PhysicalProperty` attribute after constructing the `CrystalField` object
(e.g. running `cf.PhysicalProperty = PhysicalProperties('Cv')`) causes the number of datasets to change and will
clear all `Ties` and `Constraints` previously set, and also reset all `FWHM` and `peaks` to the default values (zero
for `FWHM` and `Lorentzian` for `peaks`).


Simultaneous Fitting of Physical Properties and Inelastic Neutron Spectra
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, physical properties data and neutron spectra may be fitted simultaneously. In this case, all the inelastic
neutron spectra must be specified first in the list of input workspaces, with the physical properties dataset(s)
following in the same order as specified in the `PhysicalProperty` attribute, which for multiple physical
properties should be a list. E.g.::

    # Fits an INS spectrum (at 10K) and the heat capacity simultaneously
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544)
    cf.Temperature = 10
    cf.FWHM = 1.5
    cf.PhysicalProperty = PhysicalProperties('Cv')
    fit = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=[ws_ins_10K, ws_cp])
    fit.fit()

    # Fits two INS spectra (at 44K and 50K) and the heat capacity, susceptibility and magnetisation simultaneously.
    PPCv = PhysicalProperties('Cv')
    PPchi = PhysicalProperties('susc', 'powder', Unit='cgs')
    PPMag = PhysicalProperties('M(H)', [1, 1, 1], 5, 'bohr')
    cf = CrystalField('Ce', 'C2v', B20=0.37737, B22=3.9770, B40=-0.031787, B42=-0.11611, B44=-0.12544,
                      Temperature=[44.0, 50], FWHM=[1.1, 0.9], PhysicalProperty=[PPCv, PPchi, PPMag] )
    fit = CrystalFieldFit(Model=cf, InputWorkspace=[ws_ins_44K, ws_ins_50K, ws_cp, ws_chi, ws_mag])
    fit.fit()

Note that `PhysicalProperty` requires the type of physical property (either `'Cv'` or `'Cp'` or `'heatcap'` for
heat capacity; `'susc'` or `'chi'` for susceptibility; `'mag'` or `'M(H)'` for magnetic moment vs applied field;
or `'mom'` or `'M(T)'` for moment vs temperature) as the first argument. Subsequent arguments are optional, and
are in the following order::

    PhysicalProperties('Cp')  # No further parameters required for heat capacity
    PhysicalProperties('chi', hdir, inverse, unit)
    PhysicalProperties('chi', unit)
    PhysicalProperties('mag', hdir, temp, unit)
    PhysicalProperties('mag', unit)
    PhysicalProperties('M(T)', hmag, hdir, inverse, unit)
    PhysicalProperties('M(T)', unit)

Or these parameters may be specified using keyword arguments, with the keywords: `'Hdir'`, `'Hmag'`, `'Inverse'`,
`'Unit'`, and `'Temperature'` (note these are case sensitive, and not all parameters apply to all types of
physical properties). The default values (`Hdir=[0,0,1]`, `Hmag=1`, `Inverse=False`, `Unit='cgs'` and
`Temperature=1` are used if nothing is specified for a particular attribute.
