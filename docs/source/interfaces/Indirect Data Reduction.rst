Overview
--------

The Indirect Data Reduction interface provides the initial reduction that
is used to convert raw instrument data to S(Q, w) for analysis in the
Indirect Data Analysis and Indirect Bayes interfaces.

The tabs shown on this interface will vary depending on the current default
facility such that only tabs that will work with data from the facility are
shown, this page describes all the tabs which can possibly be shown.

ISIS/ILL Energy Transfer
------------------------

If the default facility has been set to ISIS, then the ISIS Energy Transfer tab will be available. However, this tab will 
be replaced by the ILL Energy Transfer tab if the default facility has been set to ILL. A further explanation of each tab 
can be found below.

ISIS Energy Transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tab provides you with the functionality to convert the raw data from the experiment run into 
units of :math:`\Delta E`. See the algorithm :ref:`ISISIndirectEnergyTransfer <algm-ISISIndirectEnergyTransfer>`.

ISIS Energy Transfer Options
############################

Run Files
  Allows you to select the raw data files for an experiment. You can enter these
  either by clicking on the Browse button and selecting them, or entering the run
  numbers. Multiple files can be selected, multiple run numbers can be separated
  by a comma (,) or a range can be specified by using a dash (-).

Sum Files
  If selected the data from each raw file will be summed and from then on
  treated as a single run.

Load Log Files
  If selected the sample logs will be loaded from each of the run files.

Use Calib File & Calibration File
  Allows you to select a calibration file created using the Calibration tab.

Efixed
  This option allows you to override the default fixed final energy for the
  analyser and reflection number setting. This can be useful in correcting an
  offset peak caused by the sample being slightly out of centre.

Spectra Min/Spectra Max
  Used to specify a range of spectra.

Detector Grouping
  Used to specify a method for grouping spectra. Possible grouping options include Individual, All, 
  File, Groups and Custom. The TOSCA instrument also has the Default grouping option which will use the grouping 
  specified in the IPF.

Background Removal
  Allows removal of a background given a time-of-flight range.

Detailed Balance
  Gives the option to perform an exponential correction on the data once it has
  been converted to Energy based on the temperature. This is automatically loaded 
  from the sample logs of the input file if available.

Scale by Factor
  Gives the option to scale the output by a given factor.

Do Not Rebin
  If selected it will disable the rebinning step.

Rebin Steps
  Select the type of rebinning you wish to perform.

Plot Time
  Creates a time of flight plot of the grouping of the spectra in the range
  defined in the Plot Time section. To include a single spectrum, set the Spectra
  Min and Spectra Max selectors to the same value. Note that this first rebins
  the sample input to ensure that each detector spectrum has the same binning in
  order to be grouped into a single spectrum.

Spectra Min & Spectra Max
  Select the range of detectors you are interested in, default values are
  chosen based on the instrument and analyser bank selected.

Run
  Runs the processing configured on the current tab.

Plot Output
  Allows the result to be plotted as either a spectrum plot or contour plot.

Group Output
  This will place the output reduced files from a reduction into a group workspace.

Fold Multiple Frames
  This option is only relevant for TOSCA. If checked, then multiple-framed data
  will be folded back into a single spectra, if unchecked the frames will be
  left as is with the frame number given at the end of the workspace name.

Output in :math:`cm^{-1}`
  Converts the units of the energy axis from :math:`meV` to wave number
  (:math:`cm^{-1}`).

Select Save Formats
  Allows you to select multiple output save formats to save the reduced data as,
  in all cases the file will be saved in the default save directory.

ISIS Energy Transfer Example Workflow
#####################################
The ISIS Energy Transfer tab operates on raw TOF data files. Before starting this workflow, go to
**Manage Directories** and make sure that **Search Data Archive** is set to **all**.

1. Set the **Instrument** to be OSIRIS, the **Analyser** to be graphite and the **Reflection** to
   be 002.

2. In **Run Files**, enter the run numbers 104371-104375 and press enter.

3. Change the **Spectra Min** and **Spectra Max** if you want to avoid some of the detectors. For
   the purposes of this demonstration, keep them at their default values.

4. The **Detector Grouping** option allows you to specify how you want to group your detectors. The 
   different option available are explained in the :ref:`detector-grouping` section. For this
   demonstration, choose **Individual**.

5. Click **Run** and wait for the interface to finish processing. This should generate a
   workspace ending in _red.

6. Choose a default save directory and then tick the **Nexus** checkbox. Click **Save** to save the
   output workspace. The workspace ending in _red will be used in the :ref:`elwin-example-workflow`.

Go to the :ref:`isis-calibration-example-workflow`.

.. _detector-grouping:

Grouping
########

The following options are available for grouping output data:

Custom
  Follows the same grouping patterns used in the :ref:`GroupDetectors <algm-GroupDetectors>` algorithm.
  An example of the syntax is 1,2+3,4-6,7-10

  This would produce spectra for: spectra 1, the sum of spectra 2 and 3, the sum of spectra 4-6 (4+5+6)
  and individual spectra from 7 to 10 (7,8,9,10)

Individual
  All detectors will remain on individual spectra.

Groups
  The detectors will automatically be divided into a given number of equal size groups. Any
  left over will be added as an additional group.

All
  All detectors will be grouped into a single spectra.

File
  Gives the option of supplying a grouping file to be used with the
  :ref:`GroupDetectors <algm-GroupDetectors>` algorithm.

Default 
  This grouping option is only available for TOSCA. It uses the spectra grouping specified in the IPF.

Rebinning
#########

Rebinning can be done using either a single step or multiple steps as described
in the sections below.

Single
  In this mode only a single binning range is defined as a range and width.

.. interface:: Data Reduction
  :widget: pgSingleRebin

Multiple
  In this mode multiple binning ranges can be defined using the rebin string syntax
  used by the :ref:`Rebin <algm-Rebin>` algorithm.

.. interface:: Data Reduction
  :widget: pgMultipleRebin

A note on Masked Detectors
##########################

When a reduction of a single run number takes place, the masked detectors used for the
reduction are found using the :ref:`IdentifyNoisyDetectors <algm-IdentifyNoisyDetectors>`
algorithm.

When using the **Sum Files** option the noisy detectors for each of the run numbers could
be different. In this case, the masked detectors for the summed run is found by first finding
the noisy detectors for each of the individual runs within the summed run using
:ref:`IdentifyNoisyDetectors <algm-IdentifyNoisyDetectors>`. For instance, let us say that we
find that the following run numbers have these noisy detectors:

.. code-block:: sh

  Run number 22841 has noisy detectors 53, 54, 55
  Run number 22842 has noisy detectors 53, 54, 56
  Run number 22843 has noisy detectors 53, 55, 56

To find the detectors which should be masked for a summed run of 22841-22843 we first combine
these noisy detectors so that we have 53, 54, 55 and 56. A summed file is then calculated from
these run numbers and the :ref:`IdentifyNoisyDetectors <algm-IdentifyNoisyDetectors>` algorithm
finds the noisy detectors for this summed file.

.. code-block:: sh

  Summed file 22841-22843 has noisy detectors 13, 53, 54, 55

The masked detectors used for the summed run would also include any additional detectors found
to be noisy for the summed run. The masked detectors used for the summed reduction of 22841-22843
would therefore be 13, 53, 54, 55 and 56.

ILL Energy Transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tab handles the reduction of data from the IN16B instrument and will appear when the default facility is set to be 
the ILL. See the algorithm :ref:`IndirectILLEnergyTransfer <algm-IndirectILLEnergyTransfer>`.

.. interface:: Data Reduction
  :widget: tabILLEnergyTransfer

Reduction Type
##############

There are two reduction types of IN16B data: Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) or Fixed Window Scans (FWS).
The latter can be either Elastic (EFWS) or Inelastic (IFWS).
If one or another reduction type is checked, the corresponding algorithm will be invoked
(see :ref:`IndirectILLReductionQENS <algm-IndirectILLReductionQENS>` and :ref:`IndirectILLReductionFWS <algm-IndirectILLReductionFWS>`).
There are several properties in common between the two, and several others that are specific to one or the other.
The specific ones will show up or disappear corresponding to the choice of the reduction type.

Common Options
##############

Input File
  Used to select the raw data in ``.nxs`` format. Note that multiple files can be specified following :py:obj:`MultipleFileProperty <mantid.api.MultipleFileProperty>` instructions.

Detector Grouping
  Used to switch between grouping as per the IDF (*Default*) or grouping using a
  mapping file (*Map File*). This defines e.g. the summing of the vertical pixels per PSDs.

Background Subtraction
  Used to specify the background (i.e. empty can) runs to subtract. A scale factor can be applied to background subtraction.

Detector Calibration
  Used to specify the calibration (i.e. vanadium) runs to divide by.

Background Subtraction for Calibration
  Used to specify the background (i.e. empty can) runs to subtract from the vanadium calibration runs.

Output Name
  This will be the name of the resulting reduced workspace group.

Spectrum Axis
  This allows the spectrum axis to be converted to elastic momentum transfer or scattering angle if desired.

Plot
  If enabled, it will plot the result (of the first run) as a contour plot.

Save
  If enabled the reduced workspace group will be saved as a ``.nxs`` file in the default save
  directory.

QENS-only Options
#################

Sum All Runs
  If checked, all the input runs will be summed while loading.

Crop Dead Monitor Channels
  If checked, the few channels in the beginning and at the end of the spectra that contain zero monitor counts will be cropped out.
  As a result, the doppler maximum energy will be mapped to the first and last non-zero monitor channels, resulting in narrower peaks.
  Care must be taken with this option; since this alters the total number of bins,
  problems might occur while subtracting the background or performing unmirroring if the number of dead monitor channels are different.

Calibration Peak Range
  This defines the integration range over the peak in calibration run in ``meV``.

Unmirror Options
  This is used to choose the option of summing of the left and right wings of the data, when recorded in mirror sense.
  See :ref:`IndirectILLReductionQENS <algm-IndirectILLReductionQENS>` for full details.
  Unmirror option 5 and 7 require vanadium alignment run.


FWS-only Options
################

Observable
  This is the scanning observable, that will become the x-axis of the final result.
  It can be any numeric sample parameter defined in Sample Logs (e.g. sample.*) or a time-stamp string (e.g. start_time).
  It can also be the run number. It can not be an instrument parameter.

Sort X Axis
  If checked, the x-axis of the final results will be sorted.

Sum/Interpolate
  Both background and calibration have options to use the summed (averaged) or interpolated values over different observable points.
  Default behaviour is Sum. Interpolation is done using cubic (or linear for 2 measured values only) splines.
  If interpolation is requested, x-axis will be sorted automatically.

ISIS Calibration
