Overview
--------

QECoverage is a small planning tool to allow inelastic neutron scattering users to determine graphically the 
momentum / energy transfer limits for a given spectrometer and fixed energy. 

Options
------------------

To use, select the geometry (direct or indirect) and instrument from the tabs and drop-down menu.
For direct geometry spectrometers, an incident energy (Ei) in meV must be given; for indirect geometry machines,
the final energies are fixed at a few values which must be selected from the drop-down menu.

To overplot the calculated Q-E trajectories, set the "Plot Over" check box.

You can choose to create a 1D Mantid workspace for latter plotting using the "Create Workspace" check box.

In addition, for HYSPEC, where the detector bank can be rotated, an additional parameter **S2** is required.
