Container Subtraction
---------------------

The Container Subtraction Tab is used to remove the container's contribution to a run.

Once run the corrected output and container correction is shown in the preview plot. Note 
that when this plot shows the result of a calculation the X axis is always in wavelength, 
however when data is initially selected the X axis unit matches that of the sample workspace.

The input and container workspaces will be converted to wavelength (using
:ref:`ConvertUnits <algm-ConvertUnits>`) if they do not already have wavelength
as their X unit.

Options
~~~~~~~

  \omega)` file (*_sqw.nxs*) or workspace (*_sqw*).

Corrections Details
  These options will be automatically preset to the default values read from the sample workspace, 
  whenever possible. They can be overridden manually.(see below) 

Sample Shape
  Sets the shape of the sample, this affects the options for the shape details
  (see below).

Sample Details Method
  Choose to use a Chemical Formula or Cross Sections to set the neutron information in the sample using
  the :ref:`SetSampleMaterial <algm-SetSampleMaterial>` algorithm.

Sample/Container Mass density, Atom Number Density or Formula Number Density
  Density of the sample or container. This is used in the :ref:`SetSampleMaterial <algm-SetSampleMaterial>`
  algorithm. If Atom Number Density is used, the NumberDensityUnit property is set to *Atoms* and if
  Formula Number Density is used then NumberDensityUnit is set to *Formula Units*.

  format expected by the :ref:`SetSampleMaterial <algm-SetSampleMaterial>`
  algorithm.

Correction Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Emode
  The energy transfer mode. All the options except *Efixed* require the input workspaces to be in wavelength.
  In *Efixed* mode, correction will be computed only for a single wavelength point defined by ` Efixed` value.
  All the options except *Elastic* require the Efixed value to be set correctly.
  For flat plate, all the options except *Efixed*, are equivalent.
  In brief, use *Indirect* for QENS, *Efixed* for FWS and diffraction.
  *Efixed* can be used for QENS also, if the energy transfer can be neglected compared to the incident energy.
  See :ref:`CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrections <algm-CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrection>` for the details.

Efixed
  The value of the incident (indirect) or final (direct) energy in `mev`. Specified in the instrument parameter file.

Number Wavelengths
  Number of wavelength points to compute the corrections for. Ignored for *Efixed*.

Interpolate
  Whether or not to interpolate the corrections as a function of wavelength. Ignored for *Efixed*.

dimension are required and are detailed below.

algorithm.

The options here are the same as for Cylinder.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

The main correction to be applied to neutron scattering data is that for
absorption both in the sample and its container, when present. For flat plate
geometry, the corrections can be analytical and have been discussed for example
by Carlile [1]. The situation for cylindrical geometry is more complex and
requires numerical integration. These techniques are well known and used in
liquid and amorphous diffraction, and are described in the ATLAS manual [2].

The absorption corrections use the formulism of Paalman and Pings [3] and
involve the attenuation factors :math:`A_{i,j}` where :math:`i` refers to
scattering and :math:`j` attenuation. For example, :math:`A_{s,sc}` is the
attenuation factor for scattering in the sample and attenuation in the sample
plus container. If the scattering cross sections for sample and container are
:math:`\Sigma_{s}` and :math:`\Sigma_{c}` respectively, then the measured
scattering from the empty container is :math:`I_{c} = \Sigma_{c}A_{c,c}` and
that from the sample plus container is :math:`I_{sc} = \Sigma_{s}A_{s,sc} +
\Sigma_{c}A_{c,sc}`, thus :math:`\Sigma_{s} = (I_{sc} - I_{c}A_{c,sc}/A_{c,c}) /
A_{s,sc}`.

Apply Absorption Corrections
----------------------------

The Apply Corrections tab applies the corrections calculated in the Calculate Paalman 
Pings or Calculate Monte Carlo Absorption tabs of the Indirect Data Corrections interface.

This uses the :ref:`ApplyPaalmanPingsCorrection
<algm-ApplyPaalmanPingsCorrection>` algorithm to apply absorption corrections in
the form of the Paalman & Pings correction factors. When *Use Container* is disabled
only the :math:`A_{s,s}` factor must be provided, when using a container the
additional factors must be provided: :math:`A_{c,sc}`, :math:`A_{s,sc}` and
:math:`A_{c,c}`.

Once run the corrected output and container correction is shown in the preview plot. Note 
that when this plot shows the result of a calculation the X axis is always in
wavelength, however when data is initially selected the X axis unit matches that
of the sample workspace.

The input and container workspaces will be converted to wavelength (using
:ref:`ConvertUnits <algm-ConvertUnits>`) if they do not already have wavelength
as their X unit.

The binning of the sample, container and corrections factor workspace must all
match, if the sample and container do not match you will be given the option to
rebin (using :ref:`RebinToWorkspace <algm-RebinToWorkspace>`) the sample to
match the container, if the correction factors do not match you will be given
the option to interpolate (:ref:`SplineInterpolation
<algm-SplineInterpolation>`) the correction factor to match the sample.
