Calculate Paalman Pings
-----------------------

.. interface:: Corrections
  :widget: tabCalculatePaalmanPings

Calculates absorption corrections in the Paalman & Pings absorption factors that
could be applied to the data when given information about the sample (and
optionally can) geometry.

Options
~~~~~~~

Input
  Either a reduced file (*_red.nxs*) or workspace (*_red*) or an :math:`S(Q,
  \omega)` file (*_sqw.nxs*) or workspace (*_sqw*).

Use Can
  If checked allows you to select a workspace for the container in the format of
  either a reduced file (*_red.nxs*) or workspace (*_red*) or an :math:`S(Q,
  \omega)` file (*_sqw.nxs*) or workspace (*_sqw*).

Sample Shape
  Sets the shape of the sample, this affects the options for the shape details
  (see below).

Sample/Can Number Density
  Density of the sample or container.

Sample/Can Chemical Formula
  Chemical formula of the sample or can material. This must be provided in the
  format expected by the :ref:`SetSampleMaterial <algm-SetSampleMaterial>`
  algorithm.

Plot Output
  Plots the :math:`A_{s,s}`, :math:`A_{s,sc}`, :math:`A_{c,sc}` and
  :math:`A_{c,c}` workspaces as spectra plots.

Save Result
  If enabled the result will be saved as a NeXus file in the default save
  directory.

Correction Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These options will be automatically preset to the default values read from the sample workspace, whenever possible.
They can be overridden manually.

Emode
  The energy transfer mode. All the options except *Efixed* require the input workspaces to be in wavelength.
  In *Efixed* mode, correction will be computed only for a single wavelength point defined by ` Efixed` value.
  All the options except *Elastic* require the Efixed value to be set correctly.
  For flat plate, all the options except *Efixed*, are equivalent.
  In brief, use *Indirect* for QENS, *Efixed* for FWS and diffraction.
  *Efixed* can be used for QENS also, if the energy transfer can be neglected compared to the incident energy.
  See :ref:`CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrections <algm-CylinderPaalmanPingsCorrection>` for the details.

Efixed
  The value of the incident (indirect) or final (direct) energy in `mev`. Specified in the instrument parameter file.

NumberWavelength
  Number of wavelength points to compute the corrections for. Ignored for *Efixed*.

Interpolate
  Whether or not to interpolate the corrections as a function of wavelength. Ignored for *Efixed*.

Depending on the shape of the sample different parameters for the sample
dimension are required and are detailed below.

algorithm, this algorithm is currently only available on Windows as it uses
FORTRAN code dependent of F2Py.

The options here are the same as for Cylinder.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

The main correction to be applied to neutron scattering data is that for
absorption both in the sample and its container, when present. For flat plate
geometry, the corrections can be analytical and have been discussed for example
by Carlile [1]. The situation for cylindrical geometry is more complex and
requires numerical integration. These techniques are well known and used in
liquid and amorphous diffraction, and are described in the ATLAS manual [2].

The absorption corrections use the formulism of Paalman and Pings [3] and
involve the attenuation factors :math:`A_{i,j}` where :math:`i` refers to
scattering and :math:`j` attenuation. For example, :math:`A_{s,sc}` is the
attenuation factor for scattering in the sample and attenuation in the sample
plus container. If the scattering cross sections for sample and container are
:math:`\Sigma_{s}` and :math:`\Sigma_{c}` respectively, then the measured
scattering from the empty container is :math:`I_{c} = \Sigma_{c}A_{c,c}` and
that from the sample plus container is :math:`I_{sc} = \Sigma_{s}A_{s,sc} +
\Sigma_{c}A_{c,sc}`, thus :math:`\Sigma_{s} = (I_{sc} - I_{c}A_{c,sc}/A_{c,c}) /
A_{s,sc}`.

Apply Paalman Pings
-------------------

.. interface:: Corrections
  :widget: tabApplyPaalmanPings

The Apply Corrections tab applies the corrections calculated in the Calculate
Corrections tab of the Indirect Data Analysis interface.

This uses the :ref:`ApplyPaalmanPingsCorrection
<algm-ApplyPaalmanPingsCorrection>` algorithm to apply absorption corrections in
the form of the Paalman & Pings correction factors. When *Use Can* is disabled
only the :math:`A_{s,s}` factor must be provided, when using a container the
additional factors must be provided: :math:`A_{c,sc}`, :math:`A_{s,sc}` and
:math:`A_{c,c}`.

Once run the corrected output and can correction is shown in the preview plot,
the Spectrum spin box can be used to scroll through each spectrum. Note that
when this plot shows the result of a calculation the X axis is always in
wavelength, however when data is initially selected the X axis unit matches that
of the sample workspace.

The input and container workspaces will be converted to wavelength (using
:ref:`ConvertUnits <algm-ConvertUnits>`) if they do not already have wavelength
as their X unit.

The binning of the sample, container and corrections factor workspace must all
match, if the sample and container do not match you will be given the option to
rebin (using :ref:`RebinToWorkspace <algm-RebinToWorkspace>`) the sample to
match the container, if the correction factors do not match you will be given
the option to interpolate (:ref:`SplineInterpolation
<algm-SplineInterpolation>`) the correction factor to match the sample.

Options
~~~~~~~

Input
  Either a reduced file (*_red.nxs*) or workspace (*_red*) or an :math:`S(Q,
  \omega)` file (*_sqw.nxs*) or workspace (*_sqw*).

Geometry

  Calculate Corrections).

Use Can
  If checked allows you to select a workspace for the container in the format of
  either a reduced file (*_red.nxs*) or workspace (*_red*) or an :math:`S(Q,
  \omega)` file (*_sqw.nxs*) or workspace (*_sqw*).

Scale Can by factor
  Allows the container intensity to be scaled by a given scale factor before
  being used in the corrections calculation.

Use Corrections
  The Paalman & Pings correction factors to use in the calculation, note that
  the file or workspace name must end in either *_flt_abs* or *_cyl_abs* for the
  flat plate and cylinder geometries respectively.

Plot Output
  Gives the option to create either a spectra or contour plot (or both) of the
  corrected workspace.

Save Result
  If enabled the result will be saved as a NeXus file in the default save
  directory.
