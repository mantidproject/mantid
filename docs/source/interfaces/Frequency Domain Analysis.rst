Interface Overview
------------------

This interface is used to analyse the data collected on Muon instruments in the frequency domain. The interface can be
accessed from the main menu of MantidPlot, in *Interfaces → Muon → Frequency Domain Analysis*. For sample
datasets, please visit `Muon - Downloads <http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/groups/muons/downloads/downloads4612.html>`_.

Analysis of the frequency spectrum can be achieved by clicking the fit function icon.

Loading
-------

The loading section is used to load data as well as to specify what the current runs of interest are.

**Load Current Run** This will load the latest run for the selected instrument. You must be connected to the
ISIS data archive for this to work. It also currently only works on windows.

**Run selection box** This takes a comma seperated list of run numbers and loads them all in. You may also
specify ranged of runs with a dash. For example ``62260, 62270-3`` will load ``62260, 62270, 62271, 62273``. This also specifies
which runs are used by the rest of the GUI.

**Browse** This lets you browse locally for files to load.

**Clear All** This clears all the data from the current GUI.

**Co-Add** If selected the list of runs chosen are added rather than being loaded individually.

Tabs
----

All these tabs can be dragged away from the interface into their own window.
