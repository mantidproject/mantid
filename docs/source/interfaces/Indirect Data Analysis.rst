Indirect Data Analysis
======================

.. contents:: Table of Contents
  :local:

Overview
--------

The Indirect Data Analysis interface is a collection of tools within MantidPlot
for analysing reduced data from indirect geometry spectrometers, such as IRIS and
OSIRIS.

The majority of the functions used within this interface can be used with both
reduced files (*_red.nxs*) and workspaces (*_red*) created using the Indirect Data
Reduction interface or using :math:`S(Q, \omega)` files (*_sqw.nxs*) and
workspaces (*_sqw*) created using either the Indirect Data Reduction interface or
taken from a bespoke algorithm or auto reduction.

Four of the available tabs are QENS fitting interfaces and share common features and 
layout. These common factors are documented in the :ref:`qens-fitting-features` section of this document.

These interfaces do not support GroupWorkspace as input.

Elwin
-----

Provides an interface for the :ref:`ElasticWindow <algm-ElasticWindow>`
algorithm, with the option of selecting the range to integrate over as well as
the background range. An on-screen plot is also provided.

For workspaces that have a sample log or have a sample log file available in the
Mantid data search paths that contains the sample environment information the
ELF workspace can also be normalised to the lowest temperature run in the range
of input files.

Elwin Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Input File
  Specify a range of input files that are either reduced (*_red.nxs*) or
  :math:`S(Q, \omega)`.

Group Input
  The :ref:`ElasticWindowMultiple <algm-ElasticWindowMultiple>` algorithm is performed on the input files and returns a group
  workspace as the output. This option, if unchecked, will ungroup these output workspaces.

Load History
  If unchecked the input workspace will be loaded without it's history.

Integration Range
  The energy range over which to integrate the values.

Background Subtraction
  If checked a background will be calculated and subtracted from the raw data.

Background Range
  The energy range over which a background is calculated which is subtracted from
  the raw data.

Normalise to Lowest Temp
  If checked the raw files will be normalised to the run with the lowest
  temperature, to do this there must be a valid sample environment entry in the
  sample logs for each of the input files.

SE log name
  The name of the sample environment log entry in the input files sample logs
  (defaults to ‘sample’).

SE log value
  The value to be taken from the "SE log name" data series (defaults to the
  specified value in the instrument parameters file, and in the absence of such
  specification, defaults to "last value")

Preview File
  The workspace currently active in the preview plot.

Spectrum
  Changes the spectrum displayed in the preview plot.

Plot Current Preview
  Plots the currently selected preview plot in a separate external window

Run
  Runs the processing configured on the current tab.

Plot Spectra
  If enabled, it will plot the selected workspace indices in the selected output workspace.

Save Result
  Saves the result in the default save directory.

.. _elwin-example-workflow:

Elwin Example Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Elwin tab operates on ``_red`` and ``_sqw`` files. The files used in this workflow can
be produced using the run numbers 104371-104375 on the
:doc:`Indirect Data Reduction <Indirect Data Reduction>` interface in the ISIS Energy
Transfer tab. The instrument used to produce these files is OSIRIS, the analyser is graphite
and the reflection is 002.

1. Untick the **Load History** checkbox next to the file selector if you want to load your data
   without history.

2. Click **Browse** and select the files ``osiris104371_graphite002_red``,
   ``osiris104372_graphite002_red``, ``osiris104373_graphite002_red``, ``osiris104374_graphite002_red``
   and ``osiris104375_graphite002_red``. Load these files and they will be plotted in the mini-plot
   automatically.

3. The workspace and spectrum displayed in the mini-plot can be changed using the combobox and
   spinbox seen directly above the mini-plot.

4. You may opt to change the x range of the mini-plot by changing the **Integration Range**, or
   by sliding the blue lines seen on the mini-plot using the cursor. For the purpose of this
   demonstration, use the default x range.

5. Tick **Normalise to Lowest Temp**. This option will produce an extra workspace with end suffix
   _elt. However, for this to work the input workspaces must have a temperature. See the
   description above for more information.

6. Click **Plot Current Preview** if you want a larger plot of the mini-plot.

7. Click **Run** and wait for the interface to finish processing. This should generate four
   workspaces ending in _eq, _eq2, _elf and _elt.

8. In the **Output** section, select the workspace ending with _eq and then choose some workspace
   indices (e.g. 0-2,4). Click **Plot Spectra** to plot the spectrum from the selected workspace.

9. Choose a default save directory and then click **Save Result** to save the output workspaces.
   The workspace ending in _eq will be used in the :ref:`msdfit-example-workflow`.


MSD Fit
-------

Given either a saved NeXus file or workspace generated using the Elwin tab, this
tab fits :math:`intensity` vs. :math:`Q` with one of three functions for each
run specified to give the Mean Square Displacement (MSD). It then plots the MSD
as function of run number. This is done by means of the
:ref:`QENSFitSequential <algm-QENSFitSequential>` algorithm.

MSDFit searches for the log files named <runnumber>_sample.txt in your chosen
raw file directory (the name ‘sample’ is for OSIRIS). These log files will exist 
if the correct temperature was loaded using SE-log-name in the Elwin tab. If they 
exist the temperature is read and the MSD is plotted versus temperature; if they do 
not exist the MSD is plotted versus run number (last 3 digits).

The fitted parameters for all runs are in _msd_Table and the <u2> in _msd. To
run the Sequential fit a workspace named <inst><first-run>_to_<last-run>_eq is
created of :math:`intensity` v. :math:`Q` for all runs. A contour or 3D plot of
this may be of interest.

A sequential fit is run by clicking the Run button at the bottom of the tab, a
single fit can be done using the Fit Single Spectrum button underneath the
preview plot.

The :ref:`Peters model <func-MsdPeters>` [1] reduces to a :ref:`Gaussian <func-MsdGauss>` at large 
(towards infinity) beta. The :ref:`Yi Model <func-MsdYi>` [2] reduces to a :ref:`Gaussian <func-MsdGauss>` at sigma 
equal to zero.

.. _iqt-example-workflow:

I(Q, t) Example Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The I(Q, t) tab allows ``_red`` and ``_sqw`` for it's sample file, and allows ``_red``, ``_sqw`` and
``_res`` for the resolution file. The sample file used in this workflow can be produced using the run
number 26176 on the :doc:`Indirect Data Reduction <Indirect Data Reduction>` interface in the ISIS
Energy Transfer tab. The resolution file is created in the ISIS Calibration tab using the run number
26173. The instrument used to produce these files is IRIS, the analyser is graphite
and the reflection is 002.

1. Click **Browse** for the sample and select the file ``iris26176_graphite002_red``. Then click **Browse**
   for the resolution and select the file ``iris26173_graphite002_res``.

2. Change the **SampleBinning** variable to be 5. Changing this will calculate values for the **EWidth**,
   **SampleBins** and **ResolutionBins** variables automatically by using the
   :ref:`TransformToIqt <algm-TransformToIqt>` algorithm where the **BinReductionFactor** is given by the
   **SampleBinning** value. The **SampleBinning** value must be low enough for the **ResolutionBins** to be
   at least 5. A description of this option can be found in the :ref:`a-note-on-binning` section.

3. Untick **Calculate Errors** if you do not want to calculate the errors for the output workspace which
   ends with the suffix _iqt.

4. Click **Run** and wait for the interface to finish processing. This should generate a workspace ending
   with a suffix _iqt.

5. In the **Output** section, select some workspace indices (e.g.0-2,4,6) for a tiled plot and then click
   the down arrow on the **Plot Spectra** button before clicking **Plot Tiled**.

6. Choose a default save directory and then click **Save Result** to save the _iqt workspace.
   This workspace will be used in the :ref:`iqtfit-example-workflow`.

.. _a-note-on-binning:

A note on Binning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
The bin width is determined by the energy range and the sample binning factor. The number of bins is automatically 
calculated based on the **SampleBinning** specified. The width is determined by the width of the range divided 
by the number of bins.

The following binning parameters are not enterable by the user and are instead automatically calculated through
the :ref:`TransformToIqt <algm-TransformToIqt>` algorithm once a valid resolution file has been loaded. The calculated 
binning parameters are displayed alongside the binning options:

EWidth
  The calculated bin width.

SampleBins
  The number of bins in the sample after rebinning.

ResolutionBins
  The number of bins in the resolution after rebinning. Typically this should be at
  least 5 and a warning will be shown if it is less.

F(Q) Fit
--------

One of the models used to interpret diffusion is that of jump diffusion in which
it is assumed that an atom remains at a given site for a time :math:`\tau`; and
then moves rapidly, that is, in a time negligible compared to :math:`\tau`.

This interface can be used for a jump diffusion fit as well as fitting across
EISF. This is done by means of the
:ref:`QENSFitSequential <algm-QENSFitSequential>` algorithm.

There are four QENS fitting interfaces:  

* MSD Fit
* I(Q,t) Fit, 
* Conv Fit 
* F(Q)

These fitting interfaces share common features, with a few unique options in each.

Single & Multiple Input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each interface provides the option to choose between selecting one or multiple data files to be fit.
The selected mode can be changed by clicking either the 'Single Input' tab or 'Multiple Input' tab at the the top
of the interface to switch between selecting one or multiple data files respectively.
Data may either be provided as a file, or selected from workspaces which have already been loaded.

When selecting 'Multiple Input', a table along with two buttons 'Add Workspace' and 'Remove' will be displayed.
Clicking 'Add Workspace' will allow you to add a new data-set to be fit (this will bring up a menu allowing you
to select a file/workspace and the spectra to load). Once data has been loaded, it will be displayed in the table.
Highlighting data in the table and selecting 'Remove' will allow you to remove data from the fit. Above the preview
plots will be a drop-down menu with which you can select the active data-set, which will be shown in the plots.

Custom Function Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under 'Custom Function Groups', you will find utility options for quick selection of common fit functions, specific
to each fitting interface.

The 'Fit Type' drop-down menu will be available here in each of the QENS fitting interfaces -- which is useful for
selecting common fit functions but not mandatory.

Fitting Range
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under 'Fitting Range', you may select the start and end :math:`x`-values ('StartX' and 'EndX') to be used in the fit.

Functions
~~~~~~~~~

Under 'Functions', you can view the selected model and associated parameters as well as make modifications.
Right-clicking on 'Functions' and selecting 'Add Function' will allow you to add any function from Mantid's library
of fitting functions. It is also possible to right-click on a composite function and select 'Add Function' to add a
function to the composite.

Parameters may be tied by right-clicking on a parameter and selecting either 'Tie > To Function' when creating a tie
to a parameter of the same name in a different function or by selecting 'Tie > Custom Tie' to tie to parameters of
different names and for providing mathematical expressions. Parameters can be constrained by right-clicking and
using the available options under 'Constrain'.

Upon performing a fit, the parameter values will be updated here to display the result of the fit for the selected
spectrum.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

Minimizer
  The minimizer which will be used in the fit (defaults to Levenberg-Marquadt).

Ignore invalid data
  Whether to ignore invalid (infinity/NaN) values when performing the fit.

Cost function
  The cost function to be used in the fit (defaults to Least Squares).

Max Iterations
  The maximum number of iterations used to perform the fit of each spectrum.

Preview Plots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Two preview plots are included in each of the fitting interfaces. The top preview plot displays the sample, guess
and fit curves. The bottom preview plot displays the difference curve.

The preview plots will display the curves for the selected spectrum ('Plot Spectrum') of the selected data-set
(when in multiple input mode, a drop-down menu will be available above the plots to select the active data-set).

The 'Plot Spectrum' option can be used to select the active/displayed spectrum.

A button labelled 'Fit Single Spectrum' is found under the preview plots and can be used to perform a fit of the
selected specturm.

'Plot Current Preview' can be used to plot the sample, fit and difference curves of the selected spectrum in
a separate plotting window.

The 'Plot Guess' check-box can be used to enable/disable the guess curve in the top preview plot.

Output
~~~~~~

The results of the fit may be plotted and saved under the 'Output' section of the fitting interfaces.

Next to the 'Plot' label, you can select a parameter to plot and then click 'Plot' to plot it with error 
bars across the fit spectra (if multiple data-sets have been used, a separate plot will be produced for each data-set). 
The 'Plot Output' options will be disabled after a fit if there is only one data point for the parameters.

During a sequential fit, the parameters calculated for one spectrum become the start parameters for the next spectrum to be fitted. 
Although this normally yields better parameter values for the later spectra, it can also lead to poorly fitted parameters if the
next spectrum is not 'related' to the previous spectrum. It may be useful to replace this poorly fitted spectrum with the results 
from a single fit using the 'Edit Result' option. 
Clicking the 'Edit Result' button will allow you to modify the data within your *_Results* workspace using results 
produced from a singly fit spectrum. See the algorithm :ref:`IndirectReplaceFitResult <algm-IndirectReplaceFitResult>`.

Clicking the 'Save Result' button will save the result of the fit to your default save location.

  
Bayesian (FABADA minimizer)
---------------------------

There is the option to perform Bayesian data analysis on the I(Q, t) Fit ConvFit
tabs on this interface by using the :ref:`FABADA` fitting minimizer, however in
order to to use this you will need to use better starting parameters than the
defaults provided by the interface.

You may also experience issues where the starting parameters may give a reliable
fit on one spectra but not others, in this case the best option is to reduce
the number of spectra that are fitted in one operation.

In both I(Q, t) Fit and ConvFit the following options are available when fitting
using FABADA:

Output Chain
  Select to enable output of the FABADA chain when using FABADA as the fitting
  minimizer.

Chain Length
  Number of further steps carried out by fitting algorithm once parameters have
  converged (see *ChainLength* is :ref:`FABADA` documentation)

Convergence Criteria
  The minimum variation in the cost function before the parameters are
  considered to have converged (see *ConvergenceCriteria* in :ref:`FABADA`
  documentation)

Acceptance Rate
  The desired percentage acceptance of new parameters (see *JumpAcceptanceRate*
  in :ref:`FABADA` documentation)
  
The FABADA minimizer can output a PDF group workspace when the PDF option is ticked. If this happens,
then it is possible to plot this PDF data using the output options at the bottom of the tabs.

.. _sequential-fitting-section:

Sequential Fitting
------------------

Three of the fitting interfaces allow sequential fitting of several spectra:

* MSD Fit
* I(Q, T) Fit
* ConvFit

At the bottom of the interface there are options for doing a
sequential fit. This is where the program loops through each spectrum in the
input workspace, using the fitted values from the previous spectrum as input
values for fitting the next. This is done by means of the
:ref:`IqtFitSequential <algm-IqtFitSequential>` algorithm.

A sequential fit is run by clicking the Run button seen just above the output 
options, a single fit can be done using the Fit Single Spectrum button underneath 
the preview plot.

Spectrum Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below the preview plots, the spectra to be fit can be selected. The 'Fit Spectra' drop-down menu allows for
selecting either 'Range' or 'String'. If 'Range' is selected, you are able to select a range of spectra to fit by
providing the upper and lower bounds. If 'String' is selected you can provide the spectra to fit in a text form.
When selecting spectra using text, you can use '-' to identify a range and ',' to separate each spectrum/range.

:math:`X`-Ranges may be excluded from the fit by selecting a spectrum next to the 'Mask Bins of Spectrum' label and
then providing a comma-separated list of pairs, where each pair designates a range to exclude from the fit.

ConvFit fitting model
---------------------

The model used to perform fitting in ConvFit is described in the following tree, note that
everything under the Model section is optional and determined by the *Fit Type*
and *Use Delta Function* options in the interface.

formula :math:`((x * 11.606) / T) / (1 - exp(-((x * 11.606) / T)))` where
:math:`T` is the temperature in Kelvin.
