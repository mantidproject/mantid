Instrument Selection
--------------------
This should be the first command in a user file for the following instruments:

- LOQ
- SANS2D

BACK
----
BACK is used to specify a time region in which to measure the
(time-independent) neutron background count level. The background is
calculated and subtracted from the monitor and transmission spectra before
the data are rebinned into wavelength. It is possible to set the TOF time
window for all monitors or just one specific monitor.

Syntax

    BACK/Mm/OFF

Qualifiers
^^^^^^^^^^
**/MON/TIMES**
    Set the start and end of the time of flight window assumed for all monitors

**/M**
    Used to set the time of flight window that should be used for a single
    specified monitor

**/Mm/OFF**
    This command is only relevant to use after /MON/TIMES to turn off
    background for a specific monitor.


Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^
**t1 t2**
    Neutron times of flight (microseconds) specifying the time region
    to be considered as the background level


**m**

    (note spectrum numbers start at 1 as opposed to workspace indices which are
    normally offset by 1)

position encoder values are to be corrected.

    Assumed to be an incident beam monitor unless /TRANS is specified
**/TRANS**

Syntax
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: none

    SAMPLE/OFFSET z1
    SAMPLE/PATH/ON
    SAMPLE/PATH/OFF

Qualifiers
^^^^^^^^^^

**/OFFSET**
**/PATH**

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

**z1**
    Amount (mm) by which the sample position is moved in the z-direction relative to its position specified in the IDF. For example for LOQ the IDF may place the sample position at z=11.0m. Setting z1=100mm then means the sample is translation to the position z1=11.1m, which means in this example that L1 goes from 11.0m to 11.1m.
**ON** | **OFF**
    Enable/Disable the wide-angle transmission correction. See SANSWideAngleCorrection

SET
---

SET defines the values of parameters critical to the data reduction process.

Syntax
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: none

    SET CENTRE[/MAIN] x y
    SET CENTRE/HAB x y
    SET SCALES s a b c d

Note x and y are in units of mm. For LOQ instrument, the origin is at te bottom left corner of the main detector.

Qualifiers
^^^^^^^^^^

**/MAIN**
    Define the Beam Centre position for the low-angle detector bank. This is an optional Qualifier and is set by default. (Valid only for CENTRE)
**/HAB**
    Define the Beam Centre position for the high-angle detector bank. (Valid only for CENTRE)

Command Verbs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**CENTRE**
    Defines the coordinates of the centre of the pattern on the detector and the detector pixel sizes
**SCALES**
    Defines the absolute intensity scaling factors to be applied to the reduced data

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

**x y**
    X & Y coordinates (mm) of the centre of the scattering pattern on the detector
    On LOQ the centre will always be around {320,320}, but on SANS2D the values vary depending on the sample-detector distance and the X offset of the detector (though usually y~-200). Because of the coordinate system employed on SANS2D the centre coordinates are always negative


**s a b c d**
    Dimensionless scaling factors used to rescale the reduced data into absolute values
    s is the overall scale factor determined by comparing I(0) for the standard sample with its expected value
    a, b, c & d only apply to the LOQ High-Angle Bank and must be set to 1.0 in SANS2D user files (mask files)!

TRANS
-----

TRANS is used to control how the proportion of neutrons transmitted through the sample is calculated. This can be calculated using CalculateTransmission or from a specified workspace.

**/CANWS**

**/TRANSPEC/SHIFT**
    Is used to set the z coordinate of monitor 4 or 5 to a given offset from the rear-detector and select it as the spectrum number to measure the number of neutrons through the sample. The offset is given in mm and is negative when monitor 4 is in front of the detector
**/SHIFT**
    Is used to set the z coordinate of monitor 4 and/or 5 to a given offset from the rear-detector without selecting it as the spectrum number to measure the number of neutrons. This is useful when the offsets of both monitors are given, as using /TRANSPEC/SHIFT will use the last monitor in the file as the selected monitor. The offset is given in mm and is negative when monitor 4 is in front of the detector
**/RADIUS**
    When using the detector as a beam stop, one can specify a circular region with the specified radius on this detector to measure the number of neutrons transmitted through the sample. Note that if you specified a TRANSPEC, it will be used instead.
**/ROI**
    Similar to the RADIUS we can specify a region of interest via a mask file which is used to measure the number of neutrons transmitted through the sample. Both ROI and RADIUS can be used together. Note that if you specified a TRANSPEC, it will be used instead.
**/MASK**
    This command excludes detector regions which were possibly specified by the the ROI or RADIUS command. Note that if you specified a TRANSPEC, it will be ignored.
