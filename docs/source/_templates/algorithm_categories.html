<intro> Welcome to the Mantid Algorithm Categories page. This page provides a list of the categories into which the algorithms are split.
Categories broadly correspond to either the technique that the category is used for (e.g. SANSConvertToQ is under SANS), or for
more general algorithms, the type of function it performs (e.g. Load is under Data Handling). 
The Algorithm pages generally contain the following information:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li> A brief description of the algorithm </li>
    <li> A list of input and output parameters</li>
    <li> A small worked example</li>
    <li> A link to the source code</li>
</ul>

For more in-depth discussion of the methods you can look at the <a href="../../concepts/index.html"> Concepts page</a>.

For more explicit instructions on using Mantid you can look at the <a href="../../tutorials/index.html"> Tutorials page</a>.

There is also a <a href="../index.html"> full alphabetical
    list of algorithms</a>.</intro>
