.. _FittingMinimizers:

Which minimizers to use with Mantid
===================================

Below are listed the current recommendations for which minimizers to use with Mantid:

* By default Mantid uses Levenberg-Marquardt

  We can also recommend Trust Region, in particular where accuracy is important

The above recommendations are based on the results presented in sections below.

We are expanding the set of fitting problems we test against, which may, for example, 
provide enough evidence to recommend different minimizers for different subsets of neutron
fitting problems in the future. And, we are constantly looking for new example, in
particular, where a user has found a fitting difficult or slow.

Also, if the fit minimizer benchmarking tool is available for anyone to test new minimizers
and modifications to existing minimizers.

For the task of Bayesian probability sampling: this is supported with the FABADA minimizer.

Comparing Minimizers
====================

Minimizers play a central role when :ref:`Fitting a model <Fitting>`
in Mantid. Given the following elements:

- a dataset (e.g. a spectrum),
- a model or function to fit (e.g. a peak or background function, with parameters),
- an initial guess or starting point for the parameters of the function,
- a cost function (e.g., squared residuals (fitting errors) weighted by the
  spectrum errors),
- and a minimizer.

The minimizer is the method that adjusts the function parameters so
that the model fits the data as closely as possible. The cost function
defines the concept of how close a fit is to the data. See the general
concept page on :ref:`Fitting <Fitting>` for a broader discussion of
how these components interplay when fitting a model with Mantid.

Several minimizers are included with Mantid and can be selected in the
`Fit Function property browser
<http://www.mantidproject.org/MantidPlot:_Creating_Fit_Functions>`__
or when using the algorithm :ref:`Fit <algm-Fit>` The following
options are available:

- `Simplex <../fitminimizers/Simplex.html>`__
- `SteepestDescent <../fitminimizers/GradientDescent.html>`__
- `Conjugate gradient (Fletcher-Reeves imp.) <../fitminimizers/FletcherReeves.html>`__
- `Conjugate gradient (Polak-Ribiere imp.) <../fitminimizers/PolakRibiere.html>`__
- `BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) <../fitminimizers/BFGS.html>`__
- `Levenberg-Marquardt <../fitminimizers/LevenbergMarquardt.html>`__ (default)
- `Levenberg-MarquardtMD <../fitminimizers/LevenbergMarquardtMD.html>`__
- `Damped Gauss-Newton <../fitminimizers/DampedGaussNewton.html>`__
- :ref:`FABADA <FABADA>`
- `Trust region <../fitminimizers/TrustRegion.html>`__

All these algorithms are `iterative
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_method>`__.  The *Simplex*
algorithm, also known as Nelder–Mead method, belongs to the class of
optimization algorithms without derivatives, or derivative-free
optimization. Note that here simplex refers to downhill simplex
optimization. *Steepest descent* and the two variants of Conjugate
Gradient included with Mantid (*Fletcher-Reeves* and *Polak-Ribiere*)
belong to the class of optimization or minimization algorithms
generally known as conjugate gradient, which use first-order
derivatives. The derivatives are calculated with respect to the cost
function to drive the iterative process towards a local minimum.

BFGS and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms belong to the second-order
class of algorithms, in the sense that they use second-order
information of the cost function (second-order partial derivatives of 
a Hessian matrix). Some algorithms like BFGS approximate the Hessian by the
gradient values of successive iterations. The Levenberg-Marquard
algorithm is a modified Gauss-Newton that introduces an adaptive term
to prevent instability when the approximated Hessian is not positive
defined. An in-depth description of the methods is beyond the scope of
these pages. More information can be found from the links and general
references on optimization methods such as [Kelley1999]_ and
[NocedalAndWright2006]_.

Finally, :ref:`FABADA <FABADA>` is an algorithm for Bayesian data
analysis. It is excluded from the comparison described below, as it is
a substantially different algorithm.

In most cases, the implementation of these algorithms is based on the
`GSL (GNU Scientific Library) library
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`__, and more specifically on the
`GSL routines for least-squares fitting
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Least_002dSquares-Fitting.html#Least_002dSquares-Fitting>`__


Comparison of relative goodness of fit and run time
---------------------------------------------------

Here we describe a comparison of minimizers available in Mantid, in
terms of how they perform when fitting several benchmark
problems. This is a relative comparison in the sense that for every
problem the best possible results with Mantid minimizers are given a
top score of "1". The ranking is continuous and the score of a
minimizer represents the ratio between its performance and the
performance of the best. We compare accuracy and run time.

.. Q: accuracy metric: sum of squared residuals or chi2 variants

For example, a ranking of 1.25 for a minimizer for a given problem
means:

- Referring to the accuracy of a minimizer, it produces a solution
  with squared residuals 25% larger than the best solution in Mantid.
- Referring to the run time, it takes 25% more time than the fastest
  minimizer.

All the minimizers available in Mantid 3.7 were compared, with the
exception of FABADA which belongs to a different class of methods and
would not be compared in a fair manner. For all the minimizers
compared here the algorithm :ref:`Fit <algm-Fit>` was run using the
same initialization or starting points for test every problem, as
specified in the test problem definitions.

Accuracy is measured using the sum of squared fitting errors as
metric, or "ChiSquared" as defined in :ref:`Fit
<algm-CalculateChiSquared>`, where the fitting errors are the
difference between the expected outputs and the outputs calculated by
the model fitted: :math:`\chi_{1}^{2} = \sum_{i} (y_i - f_i)^2` (see
:ref:`CalculateChiSquared <algm-CalculateChiSquared>` for full details
and different variants).  Run time is measured as the time it takes to
execute the :ref:`Fit <algm-Fit>` algorithm, i.e. the time it takes to
fit one model with one set of initial values of the model parameters against 
one dataset

.. There would be two alternative for the errors:
   1. Without errors, as it is
   2. With "simulated" sqrt(X) errors
   Here we use 2 because Levenberg-Marquardt doesn't work with 1 ('Unweighted least squares' cost function

The cost function used in this general comparison is 'Least squares'
but without using input error estimates (see details below).

Benchmark problems
##################

Each test problem included in this comparison is defined by the
following information:

- Dataset in the form of any number of pairs :math:`x_i`, :math:`y_i` with optional :math:`y_i` error estimates
- Function to fit, with parameters
- Initial values (starting point) of the function parameters
- Optional: reference best values for the parameters (some may refer to these as certified values), i.e. target parameter values for the minimizers   

The current problems have been obtained from the following sources:

- `NIST nonlinear regression problems
  <http://itl.nist.gov/div898/strd/general/dataarchive.html>`__.
- `CUTEst Constrained and Unconstrained Testing Environment on
  steroids <https://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/cutest/wiki/>`__
- A set of problems extracted from Mantid usage examples and system
  tests called here *Neutron data*. This is a first attempt at
  evaluating different minimizers using specific neutron datasets with
  real spectra and observational errors. Significant improvements are
  expected for next releases of Mantid

As the NIST and CUTEst test problems do not define observational
errors the comparison shown below does not use the weights of the
least squares cost function.  An :ref:`alternative comparison that
uses observational errors as weights in the cost function is also
available <Minimizers_weighted_comparison>`, with similar results
overall.

Comparison in terms of accuracy

Summary, median ranking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The summary table shows the median ranking across all the test
problems. See :ref:`detailed results by test problem (accuracy)
<Minimizers_unweighted_comparison_in_terms_of_accuracy>` (also
accessible by clicking on the cells of the table).

Alternatively, see the :ref:`detailed results when using weighted
least squares as cost function
<Minimizers_weighted_comparison_in_terms_of_accuracy>`.

.. Q: In tables: show values as absolute or relative to the best one
   for each problem? Absolute for the best in a column on the right?
   Relative values simplify this comparison exercise in the sense that
   we don't compare against the NIST reference or similar / one less
   problem
