Project
=======

In MantidPlot or Workbench, you can save your work into project. Then when you run
MantidPlot or Workbench at a later time you can recover this work by loading the
project. A project consists of a .mantid for MantidPlot, or .mantidproj for
Workbench, file and a collection of :ref:`Nexus files <Nexus file>` it
refers to. For this reason, a project is put into its own folder
when saved.
