In MantidWorkbench, you can save your work into a project and when you run
again at a later time you can recover this work by loading the
project. A project consists of a .mantidproj for MantidWorkbench,
file and a collection of :ref:`Nexus files <Nexus file>` it
refers to. For this reason, a project is put into its own folder
when saved.
