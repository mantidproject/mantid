Abins: Implementation details
=============================

.. contents::


Introduction
------------

Abins is a relatively complex algorithm with some unique
infrastructure and built-in design decisions. Details are collected
here: this is primarily for the benefit of those developing or
hacking Abins.


Deprecation plans
-----------------

- Support for VASP OUTCAR files is currently included for validation
  and troubleshooting purposes. Users are recommended to use the
  vasprun.xml file input.

- The *pkt_per_peak* and *fwhm* parameters in
  ``abins.parameters.sampling`` are no longer in use and should be
  removed in a future release.

- The *frequencies_threshold* parameter in
  ``abins.parameters.sampling`` is currently non-functional and should
  be removed until it *is* functional.


Sampling
--------

While the scattering cross-sections are calculated for individual
events and enumerated combinations of events, the output spectra are
histograms which have been resampled and broadened on a finite grid.

The data range is determined by three parameters:

- *min_wavenumber*, set in ``abins.parameters.sampling``
- *max_wavenumber*, set in ``abins.parameters.sampling``
- *bin_width*, a parameter set in the main Abins algorithm interface
  and passed as an argument to internal functions as appropriate. This
  parameter is more exposed than the energy range, as a convenient to
  the user. However, it should be applied consistently within a single
  application of Abins and functions may assume that this value was
  also used elsewhere.

These parameters are used to establish the edges of the sample *bins*;
the largest value is rounded up from *max_wavenumber* to contain a
whole number of *bin_width*.

The histogram of data sampled in these N bins has N-1 "points", which
should be aligned with the corresponding bin centres if plotted as a
line. In the code this array of frequency coordinates is generally
named *freq_points*.

Broadening
----------

Instrumental broadening in Abins involves an energy-dependent
resolution function; in the implemented case (the TOSCA instrument)
this is convolution with a Gaussian kernel with the energy-dependent
width parameter (sigma) determined by a quadratic polynomial.
Convolution with a varying kernel is not a common operation and is
implemented within abins.

Earlier versions of Abins implemented a Gaussian kernel with a
fixed number of points spread over a range scaled to the peak width,
set by *pkt_per_peak* and *fwhm* parameters in
``abins.parameters.sampling``.
This method leads to aliasing when the x-coordinates are
incommensurate with the histogram spacing, and an uneven number of
samples falls into each bin.

The safest way to avoid such trouble is for all broadening methods to
output onto the regular *freq_points* grid. A number of broadening
implementations have been provided in
``abins.instruments.broadening``. It is up to the Instrument
logic to dispatch broadening calls to the requested implementation,
and it is up to specific Instruments to select an appropriate scheme
for their needs.
The advanced parameter *abins.parameters.sampling['broadening_scheme']*
is made available so that this can be overruled, but it is up to the
Instrument to interpret this information. 'auto' should select an
intelligent scheme and inappropriate methods can be forbidden.

A fast, possibly-novel method of frequency-dependent broadening has
been implemented as the 'interpolate' method. For notes on this method
and its limitations see :ref:`AbinsInterpolatedBroadening`.

Testing
-------

Tests for Abins are located in a few places:

Unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~
Unit tests for the Python abins modules are in *scripts/test/Abins*.
These are set up with the other unit tests (``cmake --build . --target AllTests``)
and can be run by filtering for Abins (``ctest -R Abins``).
This will also run the Algorithm tests (next section).

Some of these tests load input data and check that the
structure/vibration data has been read correctly. There is a
consistent framework for this type of test established in
``abins.input.tester`` and inherited by
code-specific tests e.g. *AbinsLoadGAUSSIANTest*.  To create a new
reference data file with a specific build of Abins, instantiate a
Loader and pass it to *save_ab_initio_test_data*. This takes two lines of Python, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

   reader = abins.input.CRYSTALLoader(input_ab_initio_filename='my_calc.out')
   abins.input.Tester.save_ab_initio_test_data(reader, 'my_new_test')

which will write the necessary *my_new_test_data.txt* file and
*my_new_test_atomic_displacements_data_{k}.txt* files for each phonon wavevector.

Algorithm tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tests of the main Abins algorithm and of the advanced parameter
settings are in
*Framework/PythonInterface/test/python/plugins/algorithms*. These
mostly cover input sanity-checking, and check the consistency of
result scaling and splitting into atomic contributions.

System tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~
System tests are defined in *Testing/SystemTests/tests/framework/AbinsTest.py*.
These tests compare the output workspaces of Abins runs with reference Nexus files,
using the standard setup described in
`the main developer docs <http://developer.mantidproject.org/SystemTests.html>`_.
The reference data will need to be changed when major updates to Abins
impact the output results; the simplest way to obtain the new
reference files is to run the system tests, which will save Nexus
files from the failed system tests. These should be inspected to
verify that all changes were expected and understood as consequences
of changes to Abins.
