.. _RAW File:

RAW File
========

The RAW file format has been for many years the primary data format of
the ISIS facility.

Structure
---------

The Raw file is a binary formatted file that uses a simple but effective
compression system to achieve 4-1 compression of the data in holds.

Alternate Data Streams
----------------------

When the Raw file is archived to the NTFS archive additional information
about it is added as an Alternate Data Stream. This includes a list of
all of the files that were archived with this RAW file and a checksum
for each. This can provide a fast way of finding the log files
associated with a RAW file in a crowded directory.

For example:

::

    d28cb560cdefc765fc8d550b6f335006 *SANS2D00000799.log

In the links below you will streams or DIR on Vista can list the streams
on a file. Not many programs can display the contents of an alternate
data stream, but so far I have discovered that the following work, at
least for RAW files.

::

    notepad2.exe SANS2D00000799.raw:checksum
    more < SANS2D00000799.raw:checksum

If a file with an alternate data stream is copied to an FAT file system
the alternate data stream is lost. It has been reported that if a file
with an ADS is copied using SAMBA to a unix file system the streams are
extracted into separate files with automatically generates suffixes.
