Other Information on Workspaces
-------------------------------

-  :ref:`Workspace <Workspace>` - Overview of workspaces, which include the following classes:
    -  :ref:`MatrixWorkspace <MatrixWorkspace>` - A base class that contains
       among others:

       -  WorkspaceSingleValue - Holds a single number (and X & error value,
          if desired). Mainly used for workspace algebra, e.g. to divide all
          bins in a 2D workspace by a single value.
       -  :ref:`Workspace2D <Workspace2D>` - A workspace for holding two
          dimensional data in memory, this is the most commonly used
          workspace.
       -  :ref:`EventWorkspace <EventWorkspace>` - A workspace that retains the
          individual neutron event data.

    -  :ref:`TableWorkspace <Table Workspaces>` - A workspace holding data in
       rows of columns having a particular type (e.g. text, integer, ...).
    -  :ref:`WorkspaceGroup <WorkspaceGroup>` - A container for a collection of
       workspaces. Algorithms given a group as input run sequentially on
       each member of the group.
