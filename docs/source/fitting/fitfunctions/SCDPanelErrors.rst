.. index:: SCDPanelErrors

Description
-----------

This fit function is used for calibrating RectangularDetectors by
adjusting L0, time offset, panel width, panel height, panel center,
panel orientation, and allow for the sample being offset from the
instrument center.

Workspace
~~~~~~~~~

A Workspace2D with 1 spectra. The xvalues of the spectra are for each
peak, the peak index repeated 3 times. The y values are all zero and the
errors are all 1.0

This spectra may have to be copied 3 times because of requirements from
the fitting system.

Output
~~~~~~

The argument out from function1D ,for each peak, gives the error in qx,
qy, and qz. The theoretical values for the qx, qy and qz are found as
follows:

-  Calculating the best fitting UB for the given indexing and parameter
   values
-  Find U
-  The theoretical UB is then U\*B\ :sub:`0` where B\ :sub:`0` is formed
   from the supplied lattice parameters
-  The theoretical qx,qy,and qz can be obtained by multiplying the hkl
   for the peak by this matrix(/2Ï€)

   PeakWorkspaceName;;;The name of the PeaksWorkspace
   NGroups;;;The number of grouping of banks to be considered
   BankNames;;;List of banknames to group.
   startX;;;-1 or starting position in the workspace to start calculating the outputs
   endX;;;-1 or 1+ ending position in the workspace to start calculating the outputs
   RotateCenters;Boolean;;If false Rotations are only about the center of the banks.
   SampleOffsets;Boolean;;A sample being off from the center of the goniometer can result in larger errors.

-  PeakWorkspaceName - This peak must be indexed by a UB matrix 
   whose lattice parametersare CLOSE to the above lattice parameters
-  BankNames - Names separated by "/" or a "!" if the next
   bank is in a different group. Bank names from the same group 
   belong together("Requirement" for use with the Fit algorithm)
