Fitting Overview
================

This is technical documentation relating to fitting capabilities in Mantid. The fitting 
process is separated into two choices; the function and the minimizer. The function is 
how you think the data should be represented, the minimizer takes the combination of 
data and function and finds the best fit.

*Fitting functions* describes the different functions available, with a list of the parameters 
for setting up the function, as well as some examples of how to use different functions.

*Fitting minimizers* gives links to detailed descriptions of the various minimizers available in 
Mantid. Choosing the right minimizer is an art as much as a science, a discussion of choosing 
the right minimizer is provided `here. <http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/concepts/FittingMinimizers.html>`_
