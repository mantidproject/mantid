    This is technical documentation relating to fitting capabilities in Mantid. The fitting 
    process is separated into two choices; the function and the minimizer. The function is 
    how you think the data should be represented, the minimizer takes the combination of 
    data and function and finds the best fit.

    <li>Fitting functions describes the different functions available, with a list of the parameters 
    for setting up the function, as well as some examples of how to use different functions.</li>
    <li>Fitting minimizers gives links to detailed descriptions of the various minimizers available in 
    Mantid. Choosing the right minimizer is an art as much as a science, a discussion of choosing 
    the right minimizer is provided <a href='http://docs.mantidproject.org/nightly/concepts/FittingMinimizers.html'> here</a>.</li>
