Levenberg-Marquardt MD Minimizer
================================

This minimizer is the same as the :ref:`Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer <LevenbergMarquardt>` as explained
in - `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg-Marquardt_algorithm>`__ , but is intended for
:ref:`MD workspaces <MDWorkspace>`
or for a large number of data points.
It divides its work into chunks to achieve a greater efficiency for a large number of data points than
can be obtained from the default Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer.

It is listed in :ref:`a comparison of fitting minimizers <FittingMinimizers Minimizer Comparison>`.

It makes use of the
`GSL (GNU Scientific Library) library
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`__, specifically the
`GSL routines for least-squares fitting
<https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/manual/html_node/Least_002dSquares-Fitting.html#Least_002dSquares-Fitting>`__.
