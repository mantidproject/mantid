Trust Region Minimizer
======================

This minimizer is a hybrid 
`Gauss-Newton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Newton_algorithm>`__/`Quasi-Newton <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-Newton_method>`__ 
method, that makes use of a `trust region <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_region>`__.

It is a reimplementation of part of `RALFit_nonlinear least squares solver <https://github.com/ralna/RALFit>`__. 

It is listed in `a comparison of fitting minimizers <../concepts/FittingMinimizers.html>`__.
