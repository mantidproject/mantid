From the File menu you have access to standard options such as load (Open) and
save for your current :ref:`project <Project>` or scripts open in the
:ref:`script window <WorkbenchScriptWindow>`. You can also access the Workbench
settings, from which you can choose your facility and
:ref:`instrument <Instrument>`. There are also options to manage your user
directories or close the Workbench.

The manage user directory dialogue, is useful for allowing search of the
archive using the load algorithm and other parts of mantid that rely on the
file finder.
