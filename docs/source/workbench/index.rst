Mantid Workbench is the newest user interface for Mantid. The Workbench will be
included alongside MantidPlot for several releases before replacing it completely. The Workbench has been built from the
ground up to be easier to use, more stable, support automatic testing and allow future development and changes to be
completed much faster than they were in MantidPlot.  In addition it is built on more up to date toolkits that will
allow us to keep developing the Workbench long after MantidPlot is no longer available.
