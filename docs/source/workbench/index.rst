    Overview of the workbench

Mantid Workbench is the newest user interface for Mantid and has replaced MantidPlot. The Workbench has been built from the
ground up to be easier to use, more stable, support automatic testing and allow future development and changes to be
completed much faster than they were in MantidPlot.

**What is in Workbench?**
    * :ref:`WhatIsInWorkbench` This is a summary of what is in Workbench, including a diagram describing what is
      each aspect of the window.
    * :ref:`WorkbenchSmallerFeatures` A list of smaller features that does not warrant it's own pages including keyboard
