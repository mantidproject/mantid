Workbench's smaller features
============================

This is a culmination of features in workbench that don't merit having their
own independent pages.

**Smaller Features**
    * Most parts of the workbench interface can be taken from the main window
      and made into their own window. This can be done by clicking this icon:
      |draggablewindowicon|
    * Most parts of the workbench interface can also be hidden by clicking on
      the |closewindowicon| and it will disappear. To get it back use the
      :ref:`Main Window Menu's <WorkbenchMainWindowMenu>` view menu to show it
      again.
    * With the workbench comes a set of keyboard shortcuts:
