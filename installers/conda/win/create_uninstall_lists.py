# Generate files containing uninstaller commands to be included in the Windows NSIS script.
# Creates Delete commands for all files contained within the package directory, and a RMDir command for all directories.
# Two arguments are required:
# --package-dir is the location of the directory containing all files to be installed/uninstalled by NSIS
# --output-dir is where the output files (uninstall_files.nsh and uninstall_dirs.nsh) will be placed.
