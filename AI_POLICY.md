# AI Policy

AI-assisted contributions are accepted only if:

- The PR follows the same rules as a non-AI PR.
- It clearly states that it is AI-assisted and names the tool used.
- It links to an issue or discussion where a maintainer agreed to the
  proposed change beforehand.
- AI-generated descriptions/comments are clearly marked and only used when
  required.
- A human drove the tool, reviewed every line, and can explain the change.
- It was not opened by a fully autonomous agent.
- You respond to review comments yourself.

This applies to issues and comments as well as pull requests. Using AI for
translation or grammar help is fine. AI output may infringe copyright; it is
your responsibility to make sure it does not.

Unsolicited, undisclosed, or low-effort AI PRs will be closed.

Only humans can be named as co-authors, and AI can _never_ sign off on a
commit. The Linux kernel trailer should be used to credit AI assistance, like
this:

```text
Assisted-by: <harness>:<model>
```
