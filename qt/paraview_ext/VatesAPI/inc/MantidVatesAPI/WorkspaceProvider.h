/**
@class WorkspaceProvider
Abstract type for fetching and disposing of workspaces. ADS instance is a
singleton and therfore very hard to fake in testing. Attempting to test the
behaviour of types using the ADS directly was causing code-bloat. Use this
abstract type instead, which can be mocked in testing. Concrete types can
use the ADS under-the-hood.
