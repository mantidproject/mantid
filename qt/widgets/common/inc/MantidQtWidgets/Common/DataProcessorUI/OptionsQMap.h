/** This file defines utilities for handling option maps used by the data
    processor widget. These are QVariantMap equivalents of the types in
    OptionsMap.h. The QVariantMap types are required in the sip conversions for
    Python and should only be used where required for functions that are
    exposed to Python; otherwise, you should use the types in OptionsMap.h
    instead.
