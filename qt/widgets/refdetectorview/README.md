RefDetectorViewer
-----------------

The RefDetectorViewer is a specialization of the ImageViewer used in the data analysis framework for the SNS reflectometers.
It maintains code commonality with the ImageViewer as much as possible and the classes found in this package either replace (e.g. RefImageView, RefIVConnections) or extend (e.g. RefImageDisplay, RefImagePlotItem) their ImageView counterparts.
