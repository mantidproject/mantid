    The provided name is suffixed with the string 'qtX' where
    X is the major version of Qt that the library was built against.
    The version is determined by inspecting the loaded Python Qt
    bindings. If none can be found then Qt5 is assumed.

    If modulename looks like a relative name then the import is first tried as specified
    and if this fails it is attempted as a top-level import without a package name and the relative prefixes removed.
    This allows the built module to live outside of the package in a binary directory of the build. For example, a
    developer build would put the built dynamic library in the bin directory but a package installation
    would have the library in the proper location as indicated by the relative import path. This avoids any build
    products being placed in the source tree.
