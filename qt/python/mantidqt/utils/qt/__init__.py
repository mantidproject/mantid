    The version is determined by inspecting the loaded Python Qt
    bindings. If none can be found then Qt5 is assumed.

    If modulename looks like a relative name then the import is first tried as specified
    and if this fails it is attempted as a top-level import without a package name and the relative prefixes removed.
    This allows the built module to live outside of the package in a binary directory of the build. For example, a
    developer build would put the built dynamic library in the bin directory but a package installation
    would have the library in the proper location as indicated by the relative import path. This avoids any build
    products being placed in the source tree.
