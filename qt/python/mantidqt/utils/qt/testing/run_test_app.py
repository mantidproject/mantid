"""A small command line utility that can be used to manually test a widget in isolation.

Usage:

    python run_test_app.py qualified.name.of.SomeWidget [--script qualified.name.of.some_script]

The widget (and optional script) should be in the location form where python could import it as in:

    form qualified.name.of import SomeWidget

The widget is created by calling SomeWidget() constructor without arguments. If __init__ has arguments or
the widget needs to be specially prepared any function returning an instance of SomeWidget can be used instead.

Optional --script argument expects a name of a function which takes a widget as its single argument.
If specified the script is imported and run after the widget is created.
