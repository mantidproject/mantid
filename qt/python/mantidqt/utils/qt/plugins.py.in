#  On Windows the package can be installed anywhere so the locations must
#  be determined at runtime. The two options are:
#    1. using a qt.conf file: requires it to be next to the application
#       executable but this would be python.exe and then would not allow
#       switching between Qt4/Qt5
#    2. add extra paths to the LibraryPath list here
# As we can dynamically determine the Qt version here we choose option 2.
