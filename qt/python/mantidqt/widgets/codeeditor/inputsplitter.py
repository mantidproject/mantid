class InputSplitter(IPyInputSplitter):
    r"""A specialized version of IPython's input splitter.

    The major differences between this and the base version are:

      - push considers a SyntaxError as incomplete code
      - push_accepts_more returns False when the indentation has return flush
        regardless of whether the statement is a single line
    """

    def push(self, lines):
        """Push one or more lines of input.

        This stores the given lines and returns a status code indicating
        whether the code forms a complete Python block or not.

        Any exceptions generated in compilation are swallowed, but if an
        exception was produced, the method returns True.

        Parameters
        ----------
        lines : string
          One or more lines of Python input.

        Returns
        -------
        is_complete : boolean
          True if the current input source (the result of the current input
          plus prior inputs) forms a complete Python execution block.  Note that
          this value is also stored as a private attribute (``_is_complete``), so it
          can be queried at any time.
