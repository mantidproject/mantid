mantidqt.py3compat
------------------

Transitional module providing compatibility functions intended to help
migrating from Python 2 to Python 3. Mostly just wraps six but allowing
for additional functionality of our own.

This module should be fully compatible with:
    * Python >=v2.7
    * Python 3
