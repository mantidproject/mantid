# Error Reporter Resources

This directory contains a Qt resource file, `errorreports.qrc`,
which must be processed by the `pyrcc` module for the version of Qt
matching what is running.

QtPy offers no way to dynamically process this so separate `_qtX` versions
have been hand generated and placed here.
A new major version of Qt will require a new file and modifications in
report.py.
The file can be generated by running the following in this directory

```
python3 -m PyQtX.pyrcc_main -o resources_qtX.py errorreports.qrc
```

where `X` is the major version of Qt.
