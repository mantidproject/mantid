    This class provides some common functions for classes that need to be observable.
    It is not a GUI class, and if used, should be inherited by the presenter.
    It is designed to be used with a view that inherits `ObservingView`.

    The presenter that is inheriting this must initialise a model and a view,
    that implement the methods required in the functions below.
