class ObservingView(object):
    """
    This class provides some common functions needed across views observers the ADS.
    It runs the close_signal so that the view is closed from the GUI thread,
    and ensures that the closeEvent will clear the observer to prevent a memory leak.

    It is designed to be used with a presenter that inherits `ObservingPresenter`.

    If this class is inherited a `close_signal`, a `replace_signal` and a `rename_signal` must be declared.

    It is not possible to do that here, as this is not a QObject, however it was
    attempted to do the declaration here, but the signals don't seem to work
    through inheritance.

    This class shouldn't inherit from a QObject/QWidget, otherwise the closeEvent
    doesn't replace the closeEvent of the view that is inheriting this. This also
    makes it easily testable, as the GUI library isn't pulled in.

        When the signal is emitted, the execution returns to the GUI thread, and thus
