/** @class LoadMappingTable LoadMappingTable.h DataHandling/LoadMappingTable.h

Loads the mapping table between spectra and IDetector
from a raw file. It returns a SpectraDetectorTable which maintain a multimap.
The key of the multimap is the spectra number and the value
is the pointer to IDetector. The association is one to many, i.e. a spectrum can
have one or many
detectors contributing to it. Alternatively the same spectrum can contribute to
different spectra
(for example in DAE2 (Data Aquisition Electronic) when a spectra containing
electronically focussed data is created simultaneously
with individual spectra). LoadMappingTable is an algorithm and as such inherits
from the Algorithm class and overrides the init() & exec() methods.

Required Properties:
<UL>
<LI> Filename - The name of and path to the input RAW file </LI>
<LI> Workspace - The name of the workspace in which to store the imported data
</LI>
