These classes are imported from the ADARA project at ORNL (http://www.csm.ornl.gov/newsite/adara.html).
They are not part of Mantid itself, but are required to parse the live stream from SNS instruments and are used by the SNSLiveEventDataListener.

The original versions of the classes are stored in the ADARA git repo.  This can be retrieved with the command:

git clone git+ssh://trac.sns.gov/var/repos/ADARA
