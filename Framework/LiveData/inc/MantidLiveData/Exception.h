/** An exception that can be thrown by an ILiveListener implementation to
    notify LoadLiveData that it is not yet ready to return data. This could
    be, for example, because it has not yet completed its initialisation step
    or if the instrument from which data is being read is not in a run.
    LoadLiveData will ask for data again after a short delay.  Other exceptions
    thrown by the listener will have the effect of stopping the algorithm.
