/** Beamline::SpectrumInfo provides easy access to commonly used parameters of
  individual spectra (which may correspond to one or more detectors) in a
  beamline, such as mask and monitor flags, positions, L2, and 2-theta.

  Currently only a limited subset of functionality is implemented in
  Beamline::SpectrumInfo. The remainder is available in API::SpectrumInfo which
  acts as a wrapper around the old instrument implementation. API::SpectrumInfo
  will be removed once all functionality has been moved to
  Beamline::SpectrumInfo. For the time being, API::SpectrumInfo will forward
  calls to Beamline::SpectrumInfo when applicable.

  The reason for having both SpectrumInfo classes in parallel is:
  - We need to be able to move around the SpectrumInfo object including data it
    contains such as a vector of mask flags. This is relevant for the interface
    of ExperimentInfo, when replacing the ParameterMap or when setting a new
    instrument.
  - API::SpectrumInfo contains a caching mechanism and is frequently flushed
    upon modification of the instrument and is thus hard to handle outside the
    context of its owning workspace.
  Splitting SpectrumInfo into two classes seemed to be the safest and easiest
  solution to this.
