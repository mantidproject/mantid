/** We define maximal number of dimensionsMAX_MD_DIMS_POSSIBLE  which a MD
   dataset can have because
   \li a) every additional dimension will be expensive to process
   \li b) minimal size of the visualisation dataset is 2^MAX_NDIMS_POSSIBLE, so
   this number has to be reasonable and any bigger number is probably because of
   an  error;
   \li c) if we need to increase the number of dimensions, it can be easy done
   here
