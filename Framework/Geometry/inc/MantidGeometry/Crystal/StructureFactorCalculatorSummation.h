/** StructureFactorCalculatorSummation

  This implementation of StructureFactorCalculator uses the summation method
  provided by BraggScatterer and its sub-classes. It obtains all scatterers in
  the unit cell by combining the space group and the scatterers located in the
  asymmetric unit (both taken from CrystalStructure) and stores them.
