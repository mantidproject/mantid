    @class ProductOfCyclicGroups

    ProductOfCyclicGroups expands a bit on the explanations given in
    CyclicGroup. As shown for example in [1], some point groups
    cannot be expressed solely as a cyclic group. Instead it's
    necessary to multiply two or three cyclic groups to obtain all
    symmetry operations of that group.

    For this purpose, ProductOfCyclicGroups was created. It takes a set of
    n symmetry operations, each of which is seen as a generator of
    a cyclic group C_i. The resulting n groups ("factor groups") are
    multiplied to form a product group G:

        G = C_1 * C_2 * ... * C_n

    Where C_i is generated by the symmetry operation S_i. The notation
    in code to generate even large groups from a few generators
    becomes very short using this class:

        Group_const_sptr pointGroup422 =
            GroupFactory::create<ProductOfCyclicGroups>("-y,x,z; x,-y,-z");

    This is for example used in SpaceGroupFactory to create space groups
    from a small set of generators supplied in the International Tables
    for Crystallography A.
