/**
    @class CyclicGroup

    A cyclic group G has the property that it can be represented by
    powers of one symmetry operation S of order n:

        G = { S^1, S^2, ..., S^n = S^0 = I }

    The operation S^m is defined as carrying out the multiplication
    S * S * ... * S. To illustrate this, a four-fold rotation around
    the z-axis is considered. The symmetry operation representing the
    transformation by this symmetry element is "-y,x,z". This is also the
    first member of the resulting group:

        S^1 = S = -y,x,z

    Then, multiplying this by itself:

        S^2 = S * S = -x,-y,z
        S^3 = S * S * S = y,-x,z
        S^4 = S * S * S * S = x,y,z = I

    Thus, the cyclic group G resulting from the operation "-y,x,z" contains
    the following members:

        G = { S^1, S^2, S^3, I } = { -y,x,z; -x,-y,z; y,-x,z; x,y,z }

    This example shows in fact how the point group "4" can be generated as
    a cyclic group by the generator S = -y,x,z. Details about this
    are given for example in [1].

    In code, the example is very concise:

        Group_const_sptr pointGroup4 =
            GroupFactory::create<CyclicGroup>("-y,x,z");

    This is much more convenient than having to construct a Group,
    where all four symmetry operations would have to be supplied.

    Related to this class is ProductOfCyclicGroups, which provides an easy way
    to express a group that is the product of multiple cyclic groups
    (such as some point groups).
