    @class SymmetryOperation

    Crystallographic symmetry operations are composed of a rotational component,
    which is represented by a matrix and a translational part, which is
    described by a vector.

    In this interface, each symmetry operation has a so-called order,
    which is an unsigned integer describing the number of times a
    symmetry operation has to be applied to an object until it is identical.

    Furthermore, each symmetry operation has a string-identifier. It contains
    the Jones faithful representation of the operation, as it is commonly used
    in many crystallographic programs and of course the International Tables
    for Crystallography, where the symmetry operations and their representations
    may be found [1].

    The Jones faithful notation is a very concise way of describing
    matrix/vector pairs. The matrix/vector pair of a two-fold rotation
    axis along z is for example:

        Matrix      Vector
        -1  0  0     0
         0 -1  0     0
         0  0  1     0

    This is described by the symbol '-x,-y,z'. If it were a 2_1 screw axis
    in the same direction, the matrix/vector pair would look like this:

        Matrix      Vector
        -1  0  0     0
         0 -1  0     0
         0  0  1    1/2

    And this is represented by the string '-x,-y,z+1/2'. In hexagonal systems
    there are often operations involving 1/3 or 2/3, so the translational part
    is kept as a vector of rational numbers in order to carry out precise
    calculations. For details, see the class Kernel::V3R.

    Using the symmetry operations in code is easy, since
    SymmetryOperationSymbolParser is automatically called by the string-based
    constructor of SymmetryOperation and the multiplication operator
    is overloaded:

        SymmetryOperation inversion("-x,-y,-z");
        V3D transformed = inversion * V3D(1, 1, -1); // results in -1, -1, 1

    The operator is templated and works for any object Kernel::IntMatrix can be
    multiplied with and V3R can be added to (for example V3R, V3D). Note that
    for the transformation of HKLs, the matrix needs to be transposed. In some
    cases, such as the example above, it does not matter, because the matrix is
    identical to its transposed. In general however, transposing is necessary,
    so there is a dedicated method for that:

        SymmetryOperation sixFold("x-y,x,z");
        V3D hklPrime = sixFold.transformHKL(V3D(1,0,0)); //


    A special case is the multiplication of several symmetry operations, which
    can be used to generate new operations:

        SymmetryOperation inversion("-x,-y,-z");
        SymmetryOperation identity = inversion * inversion;

    Please note that the components of the vector are wrapped to
    the interval (0, 1] when two symmetry operations are combined.

    Constructing a SymmetryOperation object from a string is heavy, because the
    string has to be parsed every time. It's preferable to use
    the available factory:

        SymmetryOperation inversion =
            SymmetryOperationFactory::Instance().createSymOp("-x,-y,-z");

    It stores a prototype of the created operation and copy constructs a new
    instance on subsequent calls with the same string.

    SymmetryOperation-objects are for example used in PointGroup.
