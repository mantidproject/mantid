    @class ConventionalCell

    Instances of this class represent information about a selected
    conventional cell based on a specified UB for a Niggli reduced cell.
    An instance of the class records the original UB matrix, as well as the
    new UB for the conventional cell, the maximum error in the scalars,
    cell type and centering.
    See "Lattice Symmetry and Identification -- The Fundamental Role of Reduced
     Cells in Materials Characterization", Alan D. Mighell, Vol. 106, Number 6,
    Nov-Dec 2001, Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards
    and Technology.  This class is a direct port of the ISAW class
    ReducedCellInfo.
