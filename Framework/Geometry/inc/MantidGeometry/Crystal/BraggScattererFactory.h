/**
    @class BraggScattererFactory

    This class implements a factory for concrete BraggScatterer classes.
    When a new scatterer is derived from BraggScatterer, it should be registered
    in the factory. Like other factories in Mantid, a macro is provided for
    this purpose:

        DECLARE_BRAGGSCATTERER(NewScattererClass)

    At runtime, instances of this class can be created like this:

        BraggScatterer_sptr scatterer =
        BraggScattererFactory::Instance().createScatterer("NewScattererClass");

    The returned object is initialized, which is required for using the
    Kernel::Property-based system of setting parameters for the scatterer.
    To make creation of scatterers more convenient, it's possible to provide
    a string with "name=value" pairs, separated by semi-colons, which assigns
    property values. This is similar to the way
    FunctionFactory::createInitialized works:

        BraggScatterer_sptr s = BraggScattererFactory::Instance()
                                               .createScatterer(
                                                    "NewScatterer",
                                                    "SpaceGroup=F m -3 m;"
                                                    "Position=[0.1,0.2,0.3]");

    If you choose to use the raw create/createUnwrapped methods, you have to
    make sure to call BraggScatterer::initialize() on the created instance.
