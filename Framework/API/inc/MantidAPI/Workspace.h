  /** Returns a clone (copy) of the workspace with covariant return type in all
   * derived classes.
   *
   * Note that this public function is *not* virtual. This has two reasons:
   * - We want to enforce covariant return types. If this public clone() method
   *   was virtual some derived class might fail to reimplement it. Since there
   *   are several levels of inheritance in the Workspace inheritance tree we
   *   cannot just use a pure virtual method in the base class. Thus, we use
   *   this non-virtual interface method which calls the private and virtual
   *   doClone() method. Since it is private, failing to reimplement it will
   *   cause a compiler error as a reminder. Note that this mechanism does not
   *   always work if a derived class does not implement clone(): if doClone()
   *   in a parent is implemented then calling clone on a base class will return
   *   a clone of the parent defining doClone, not the actual instance. This is
   *   more a problem of the inheritance structure, i.e., whether or not all
   *   non-leaf classes are pure virtual and declare doClone()=0.
   * - Covariant return types are in conflict with smart pointers, but if
   *   clone() is not virtual this is a non-issue.
