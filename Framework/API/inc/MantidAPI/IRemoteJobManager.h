/**
Common interface to different remote job managers (job schedulers, web
services, etc. such as MOAB, Platform LSF, or SLURM).

IremoteJobManager objects are (in principle) created via the
RemoteJobManagerFactory.  There are several "remote algorithms" in
Mantid: Authenticate, SubmitRemoteJob, QueryRemoteJobStatus,
etc. These algorithms are meant to use this interface to the different
specific implementations. Or, from the opposite angle, the methods of
this interface provide the functionality required by the remote
algorithms in a generic way (with respect to different job schedulers
or underlying mechanisms to handle remote jobs). So-called remote job
manager classes can implement this interface to provide
specialisations for Platform LSF, SLURM, MOAB, the Mantid web service
API, etc.

A typical sequence of calls when you use this interface would be:

1) Authenticate/log-in (authenticate())
2) Do transactions

Where the sequence of calls within a transaction is:

2.1) Start transaction (startRemoteTransaction())
2.2) Do actions
2.3) Stop transaction (stopRemoteTransaction())

In 2.2, several types of actions are possible:
- Submit a job to run on the (remote) compute resource (submitRemoteJob()).
- Get status info for one or all jobs (queryRemoteJob() and
queryAllRemoteJobs()).
- Cancel a job (abortRemoteJob()).
- Get list of available files for a transaction on the compute resource
(queryRemoteFile())
- Upload / download files ( uploadRemoteFile() and downloadRemoteFile()).
