/**
The ScriptRepository class is intended to be used mainly by the users, who
will be willing to share and download scripts for their analysis. As so,
the exceptions that may occurr while operating must provide information that
are usefull for them to understand what is happening, but, the Mantid Team
must still be informed what happened in more techinical detail in order
to be able to deal with eventually bugs.

To provide this functionality, the ScriptRepoException will be used.
As a normal std::exception (the default base one used through all the
Mantid Project), it allows Mantid to work as normally.

But, it extends the usage of the exception, by allowing more information
to be added. Below, some examples on how to trigger exceptions.

\code

// throw "Unknown Exception"
throw ScriptRepoException();

// After system changing errno number, for example, EACCES
// You could give the user the reason way he can not download the file.
throw ScriptRepoException(EACCES, "You can allowed to download scripts. Please,
contact the administrator");

// For more serious exception, you could provide the location where it
// were triggered.
throw ScriptRepoException(errno, "Critical Failure", __FILE__, __LINE__)
\endcode

The default ScriptRepoException::what method will be used to show the user
message, while it is up to whom is using the ScriptRepository to decide on
using or not the techinical information through
ScriptRepoException::systemError,
ScriptRepoException::filePath.

/**
Abstract Class to manage the interaction between the users and the Script folder
(mantid subproject).

Inside the mantid repository (https://github.com/mantidproject) there is also a
subproject called
scripts (https://github.com/mantidproject/scripts), created to allow users to
share their scripts,
as well as to allow Mantid Team to distribute to the Mantid community scripts
for analysis and
also to enhance the quality of the scripts used for the sake of data analysis.

The ScriptRepository interface aims to provide a simple way to interact with
that repository in order to
promote its usage. In order to enhance the usage, it is necessary:

  - List all scripts available at the repository
  - Download selected scripts.
  - Check for updates
  - Allow to publish users scripts/folders.

ScriptRepository may show all the files inside the script repository through
ScriptRepository::listFiles.
Only the names of the files may not be sufficient, to help deciding if the file
would be usefull or
not, so, the author, the description and when the file was last changed can be
accessed through
ScriptRepository::ScriptInfo.

The list of the files could become confusing if a large amount of automatically
created files is installed.
In order to avoid this, it is possible to edit the file patterns that should be
ignored when listing files,
this is done through ScriptRepository::setIgnorePatterns, and you can check this
settings through the
ScriptRepository::ignorePatterns.

After looking at a file, you may be interested in downloading it through
ScriptRepository::download.

When working with the repository, the files may be local only, if the user
created a file inside
his folder, it may not be downloaded, it can be locally modified, or changed
remotely and
not up-to-date, or even, being modified locally and remotely. Use
ScriptRepository::fileStatus in
order to get these informations of any file.

The user may decide to upload one of his file or folder, to share it. This is
possible through
the ScriptRepository::upload. The same command may be used to publish also some
updates made to an
already shared file.

Finally, the ScriptRepository have to check periodically the remote repository
(https://github.com/mantidproject/scripts), but it will be done indirectly
through a mantid web service,
it is the responsibility of external tools to ensure
it is done periodically, through ScriptRepository::check4Update. For the sake of
simplicity, this method
is used also to create the local repository in case it does not exists.

Before using the ScriptRepository, it must be installed inside a local folder
(ScriptRepository::install).
If ScriptRepository is not created pointing to a valid local repository, the
methog ScriptRepository::isValid
will return false, and no method will be available, except, install.
As a good practice, it is good to ensure that the connection between the local
object and the
mantid web service is available, through the ScriptRepository::connect.

@note Exceptions will be triggered through ScriptRepoException in order user
      understandable information as well as techinical details.


@note Mantid::API::ScriptRepositoryImpl implements this class.

/** @page ScriptRepositoryDescription The Description of the ScriptRepository
Files

@section script-description-sec Scripts, Folders and Files Description

The description of the files and scripts will obey an agreement for the
following type of files:

 - @ref pyscript-sec
 - @ref folders-sec
 - @ref readme-sec


@subsection pyscript-sec Python Scripts

If the script is as python file, then the description will be the module __doc__
attribute.
If this information is not availabe, them, it will try to get the first group of
comments, at the
header of the file. For
example, the following code:

@code{.py}
import mantid
print mantid.__doc__
@endcode

Produces:

@verbatim
Mantid
======

http://www.mantidproject.org

The Mantid project pro (...)
@endverbatim

Another example, consider this python file:

@code{.py}
#!/usr/bin/env python

## This module is responsible to display a
## 'Hello world' greeting.

print 'Hello world'
@endcode

Will show the description as follow:

@verbatim
This module is responsible to display a
'Hello world' greeting.
@endverbatim

@subsection folders-sec Folders

If the script is a folder, it will try to find a file __init__.py, so to check
if this folder is
a python module. If it does, it will parse the __init__.py as in section @ref
pyscript-sec. Otherwise,
it will look for a file starting with name README, and will show it.
For example, if the mantid repository path would be passed,
it would show the content of its README.md file:

@verbatim
Mantid
======

The Mantid project provides (...)

@endverbatim

In this case, author should be any name found inside the README file that starts
with
the following line: 'Author:'.


@subsection readme-sec README files

They will work as was expected for folders @ref folders-sec.
