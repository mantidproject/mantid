/**
  A property to allow a user to specify multiple files to load.

  The current functionality is such that there are two basic forms of syntax.
  For the puposes
  of documentation we'll call these the "Long Form" and "Short Form".

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [A] Short Form

      These strings are of the format "[dir][inst][under][runs][ext]" where:

      [dir]   (Optional) = The OS-specific file directory, e.g. "c:/data/"
      [inst]  (Optional) = The instrument name, e.g. "IRS" or "PG3".
      [under] (Optional) = Some instrument filenames require an underscore.
      [runs]  (Required) = The run numbers, e.g. "0102, 0110-0115, 0120,
  0130:0140:2"
      [ext]   (Optional) = The file extension, e.g. ".raw"

      For optional values, defaults or user settings are used where necessary.

      For [runs], users specify lists and ranges of runs using comma, plus,
  minus and colon.  Some examples:

      "TSC0001,0002"       = Runs 1 and 2 of the TOSCA instrument are to be
  loaded.
      "0003+0004"          = Runs 3 and 4 of the default instrument are to be
  loaded and added together.
      "0005:0009.raw"      = The raw files containing runs 5 to 9 of the default
  instrument are to be loaded.
      "c:/data/0010-0014"  = The files in "c:/data/" containing runs 10 to 14 of
  the default instrument are
                             to be loaded and added together.
      "IRS0020:0028:2.nxs" = The nexus files containing runs 20, 22, 24, 26 and
  28 for IRIS are to be loaded.
      "INST_0030-0038:3"   = Runs 30, 33, and 36 of INST are to be loaded and
  added together.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  [B] Long Form

      These strings are of the format "[[short_form][operator]]...[short_form]"
  where:

      [short_form] = [dir][inst][under][runs][ext], which is the "Short Form"
  outlined above.
      [operator]   = Either a comma or a plus.

      Some examples:

      "TSC0001,TSC0002+0003"        = Runs 1, 2 and 3 of the TOSCA instrument
  should be loaded, but 2 and 3
                                      are added together.
      "TSC0005+TSC0006,TSC0007.raw" = Runs 5 and 6 as well as the raw file
  containing run 7 of the TOSCA
                                      instrument should be loaded, but 5 and 6
  are added together.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTES:

  [1] Presently, we disallow more complex algebra such as
  "TSC0005,0006+TSC0007". In such a case it is
      ambiguous whether or not the user wishes to just add run 7 to 6, or add
  run 7 to both 5 and 6.

  [2] The "Short Form" is parsed by the Kernel::MultiFileNameParsing::Parser
  class, whereas this class is
      responsible for splitting up the Long Form.

  [3] The functionality of this class is such that all strings are stored only
  after being converted to
      the Long Form, and all filenames are fully resolved.  For example
  "0005,0006+0007" is stored as
      "[dir][inst][under]0005[ext],[dir][inst][under]0006[ext]+[dir][inst][under]0007[ext]".

  [4] The default functionality of this Property can be changed to emulate a
  simple FileProperty - to do
      this, the user must change the properties file.  Disabling multi file
  loading in this way will allow
      users to use "," and "+" in their filenames, and in this case we use the
  dummy "" delimiters to call
      toValue and toString.
