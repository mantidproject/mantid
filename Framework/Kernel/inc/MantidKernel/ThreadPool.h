/** A Thread Pool implementation that keeps a certain number of
 * threads running (normally, equal to the number of hardware cores available)
 * and schedules tasks to them in the most efficient way possible.
 *
 * This implementation will be slanted towards performing many more
 * Task's than there are available cores, so threads will be reused.
