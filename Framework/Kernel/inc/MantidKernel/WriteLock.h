/** Scoped write-lock for thread-safe access to DataItems.
 *
 * Acquire a WriteLock on a workspace that you will be modifying.
 * This blocks any other thread from reading/writing to the
 * workspace.
 *
 * Note that normally, you SHOULD NOT CALL THIS IN AN ALGORITHM,
 * because read- or write-locking of the input or output
 * workspaces is taken care of in the Algorithm class.
 *
 * The write lock is automatically unlocked when the variable goes
 * out of scope (in the destructor). Multiple read-locks can
 * be acquired simultaneously, but only one write-lock.
 *
 * Sample Usage:
 *  {
 *    WriteLock _lock(*workspace_sptr);
 *    // Modify the workspace
 *  }
 *  // Lock has been released when _lock when out of scope.
