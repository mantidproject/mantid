# Defines a rule to compile all of the Python files that have been installed as
# part of the package.

# CMake seems to put all of the current-level install commands "before" any sub-
# directories that you have added, even if you add them before the install rule.

# To ensure that this script runs after everything is installed it is in this
# subdirectory so that it can be the last thing added. It is at the Framework
# level so that a "Framework Only" build is still valid.

# When building the package CPack installs into
# ${DESTDIR}${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} but this should be evaluated at CPack time
# so escape the $ to its written literally.
