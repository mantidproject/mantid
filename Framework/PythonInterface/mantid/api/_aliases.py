# Historically the singleton aliases mapped to the instances rather than
# the class types, i.e. AnalysisDataService is the instance and not the type,
# which doesn't match the C++ behaviour.
#
# Exit handlers are important in some cases as the associated singleton
# stores references to python objects that need to be cleaned up
# Without a python-based exit handler the singletons are only cleaned
# up after main() and this is too late to acquire the GIL to be able to
# delete the python objects.
# If you see a segfault late in a python process related to the GIL
# it is likely an exit handler is missing.
