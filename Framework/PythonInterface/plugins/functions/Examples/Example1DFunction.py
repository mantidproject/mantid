"""
This example implements a simple Linear function that could be used as a background.

It uses the generic concept of a 1D function, which has no concept that the function
may have a peak-like attributes such as a centre, width or fwhm. If your function can be defined
to have meaningful concepts such as this then see ExamplePeakFunction.

1D functions do not have to have a derivative defined, if they do not then they will use a numerical
derivative
