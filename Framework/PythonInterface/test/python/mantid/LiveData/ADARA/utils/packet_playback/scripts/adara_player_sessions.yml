# Notes:
# - At the moment, we're simply *ignoring* any metadata-only files.
#   Including these files in the playback generates "duplicate device-descriptor for XX"
#   and "XX is not a time-series property" errors;
# - This should be OK because the event-bearing files do contain the device-descriptor sections.
