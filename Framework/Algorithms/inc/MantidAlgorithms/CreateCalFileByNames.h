/** Create a calibration file for diffraction focussing (*.cal old Ariel format)
 *  based on list of names of the instrument tree.
 *  The offsets are all sets to zero and all detectors are selected. Detectors
 not assigned
 *  to any group will appear as group 0, i.e. not included when using
 AlignDetector or
 *  DiffractionFocussing algorithms.
 *  The group number is assigned based on a descent in the instrument tree
 assembly.
 *  If two assemblies are parented, say Bank1 and module1, and both assembly
 names
 *  are given in the GroupNames, they will get assigned different grouping
 numbers.
 *  This allows to isolate a particular sub-assembly of a particular leaf of the
 tree

    Required Properties:
    <UL>
    <LI> InstrumentName   - The name of the instrument. Needs to be present in
 the store</LI>
    <LI> GroupingFilename - The name of the output file (*.cal extension) .</LI>
    <LI> GroupNames       - Name of assemblies to consider (names separated by
 "/" or "," or "*"</LI>
    </UL>
