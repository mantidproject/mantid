/** Compute the generalised second difference of a spectrum or several spectra
 based on the method
 * described by M.A. Mariscotti., Nuclear Instruments and Methods 50, 309
 (1967).
 * This is used for example by a peak-finding algorithm.
 * Given a spectrum with value yi (0<=i<n), the generalised second difference
 corresponds to
 * the second difference curve, smoothed by averaging each point in the interval
 [-m,+m],
 * and applying this procedure z times.
