    This algorithm uses numerical integration method to calculate attenuation
   factors
    resulting from absorption and single scattering in a cylindrical sample with
   the dimensions and material
    properties given. Factors are calculated for each spectrum (i.e. detector
   position) and wavelength point,
    as defined by the input workspace. The sample is divided up into a stack of
   slices, which are then divided
    into annuli (rings). These annuli are further divided to give the full set
   of elements for which a calculation
    will be carried out. Thus the calculation speed depends linearly on the
   total number of bins in the workspace
    and on the number of slices. The dependence on the number of annuli is
   stronger, going as 3n(n + 1).

    Path lengths through the sample are then calculated for the centre-point of
   each element and a numerical
    integration is carried out using these path lengths over the volume
   elements.

    This algorithm assumes that Y (the sample cylinder axis) is up.
