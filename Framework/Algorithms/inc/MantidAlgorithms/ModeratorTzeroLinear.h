/* Corrects the time of flight (TOF) by a time offset that is dependent on the
 velocity of the neutron after passing through the moderator.
 * "The TOF measured by the BASIS data acquisition system (DAS) should be
 reduced by this moderator emission time. The DAS "erroneously"
 *  thinks that it takes longer for neutrons to reach the sample and detectors,
 because it does not "know" that the neutrons
 *  spend some time in the moderator before being emitted and starting flying" -
 E. Mamontov
 *
 *  A heuristic formula for the correction, stored in the instrument definition
 file, is taken as linear on the initial neutron wavelength lambda_i:
 *    t_0 = gradient * lambda_i + intercept,  [gradient]=microsec/Angstrom and
 [intercept]=microsec
 *
 *  Required Properties:
    <UL>
    <LI> InputWorkspace  - EventWorkSpace in TOF units. </LI>
    <LI> OutputWorkspace - EventWorkSpace in TOF units. </LI>
    <LI> Moderator.Tzero.gradient - Variation of the time offset with initial
 neutron wavelength (obtained from the instrument parameter file)
    <LI> Moderator.Tzero.intercept - time offset common to all neutrons
 (obtained from the instrument parameter file)
    </UL>

         The recorded TOF = t_0 + t_i + t_f with
                 t_0: moderator emission time
                 t_i: time from moderator to sample
                 t_f: time from sample to detector
         This algorithm will replace TOF with TOF' = TOF-t_0 = t_i+t_f

         For a direct geometry instrument, lambda_i is the same for all
 neutrons. Hence the moderator emission time is the same for all neutrons
         For an indirect geometry instrument, lambda_i is not known but the
 final energy, E_f, selected by the analyzers is known. For this geometry:
                 t_f = L_f/v_f   L_f: distance from sample to detector, v_f:
 final velocity derived from E_f
                 t_i = L_i/v_i   L_i: distance from moderator to sample, v_i:
 initial velocity unknown
                 t_0 = a/v_i+b   a and b are constants derived from the
 aforementioned heuristic formula.
                                 a=gradient*3.956E-03, [a]=meter,
 b=intercept, [b]=microsec
                 Putting all together:  TOF' = (L_i/(L_i+a))*(TOF-t_f-b) + t_i,
 [TOF']=microsec
