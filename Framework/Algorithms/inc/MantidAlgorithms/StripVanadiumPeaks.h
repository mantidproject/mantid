/** StripVanadiumPeaks algorithm

    This algorithm takes a list of peak centers (or uses a default one for
   Vanadium peaks)
    and cuts them out by performing a linear fit of the Y values to the left and
   right of the peak:

    - The center of the peak C is specified in d-spacing.
    - A peak width W is specified as a percentage of the d-spacing at the peak
   center.
    - A width of W/2 is averaged on the left and right sides, centered at C +-
   W/2.
    - A linear fit is made from those two value.
    - The Y values between C-W/2 and C+W/2 are filled in with the result of the
   fit.
