/** A spherical absorption correction algorithm.

    Common Properties:
    <UL>
    <LI> InputWorkspace  - The name of the input workspace. </LI>
    <LI> OutputWorkspace - The name of the output workspace. Can be the same as
   the input one. </LI>
    <LI> AttenuationXSection - The attenuation cross-section for the sample
   material in barns. </LI>
    <LI> ScatteringXSection - The scattering cross-section for the sample
   material in barns. </LI>
    <LI> SampleNumberDensity - The number density of the sample in
   Angstrom^-3.</LI>
    </UL>

    This class, which must be overridden to provide the specific sample geometry
   and integration
    elements, uses a numerical integration method to calculate attenuation
   factors resulting
    from absorption and single scattering in a sample. Factors are calculated
   for each spectrum
    (i.e. detector position) and wavelength point, as defined by the input
   workspace.
    Path lengths through the sample are then calculated for the centre-point of
   each element
    and a numerical integration is carried out using these path lengths over the
   volume elements.

    This algorithm assumes that the beam comes along the Z axis, that Y is up
    and that the sample is at the origin.
