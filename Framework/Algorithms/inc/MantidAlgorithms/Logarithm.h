/** Takes a workspace as input and calculates the natural logarithm of number of
   counts for each 1D spectrum.
    The algorithm creates a new workspace containing logarithms of signals
   (numbers of counts) in

    Required Properties:
    <UL>
    <LI> InputWorkspace - The name of the workspace to take as input </LI>
    <LI> OutputWorkspace - The name of the workspace in which to store the
   result </LI>
    </UL>

    Optional Properties (assume that you count from zero):
    <UL>
    <LI> Filler  -- A workspace can normally have zeros in it and the logarithm
   goes to minys infinity for zeros.
                    This field keeps value, that should be placed in the
   workspace instead of minus infinity </LI>
    <LI> Natural -- Natural or base 10 logarithm. Default is natural </LI>
    </UL>
