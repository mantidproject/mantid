    This algorithm uses numerical integration method to calculate attenuation
   factors
    resulting from absorption and single scattering in a flat plate sample with
   the dimensions
    and material properties given. Factors are calculated for each spectrum
   (i.e. detector position)
    and wavelength point, as defined by the input workspace.
    The sample is divided up into a small cubes and thenpath lengths through the
   sample are
    calculated for the centre-point of each element and a numerical
    integration is carried out using these path lengths over the volume
   elements.
