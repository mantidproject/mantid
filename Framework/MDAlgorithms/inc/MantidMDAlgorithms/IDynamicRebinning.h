/**   Class provides commont interface for various classes performing rebinning
 operations;

 A rebinning class is selected from availible classes which do rebinning
 operations on
 user request and the ability to do the job.

 TODO: A factory should analyse the demands for the job and user requests and
 return the method best suitable for the operations
       but the common interface for the rebinning can be identified and is
 described here.
