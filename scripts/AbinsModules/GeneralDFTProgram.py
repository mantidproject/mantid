        This method is different for different DFT programs. It has to be overridden by inheriting class.
        This method should do the following:

          1) Open file with phonon data (CASTEP: foo.phonon). Name of a file should be stored in self._input_filename.
          Only one dot '.' is expected in the name of a file. There must be no spaces in the name of a file. Extension
          of file (part of a name after '.') is arbitrary.

          2) Method should read from a phonon file an information about frequencies, atomic displacements,
          k-point vectors, weights of k-points and ions.

          3) Method should reconstruct data for symmetry equivalent k-points
             (protected method _recover_symmetry_points).

             **Notice: this step is not implemented now. At the moment only Gamma point calculations are supported.**

          4) Method should determine symmetry equivalent atoms

              **Notice: this step is not implemented now.**

          5) Method should calculate hash of a file with phonon data (protected method _calculateHash).

          6) Method should store phonon data in an hdf file (inherited method save()). The name of an hdf file is
          foo.hdf5 (CASTEP: foo.phonon -> foo.hdf5). In order to save the data to hdf file the following fields
          should be set:

                    self._hdf_filename
                    self._group_name
                    self._attributes
                    self._datasets

              The datasets should be a dictionary with the following entries:

                        "frequencies"  - frequencies for all k-points grouped in one numpy.array in cm^-1

                        "weights"      - weights of all k-points in one numpy.array

                        "k_vectors"    - all k-points in one numpy array

                                         **Notice: both symmetry equivalent and inequivalent points should be stored; at
                                          the moment only Gamma point calculations are supported**

                        "atomic_displacements" - atomic displacements for all atoms and all k-points in one numpy array

                        "unit_cell"      -   numpy array with unit cell vectors in Angstroms

              The following structured datasets should be also defined:

                        "atoms"          - Python dictionary with the information about ions. Each entry in the
                                           dictionary has the following format 'atom_n'. Here n means number of
                                           atom in the unit cell.

                                           Each entry 'atom_n' in the  dictionary is a dictionary with the following
                                           entries:

                                               "symbol" - chemical symbol of the element (for example hydrogen -> H)

                                               "sort"   - defines symmetry equivalent atoms, e.g, atoms with the same
                                                          sort are symmetry equivalent

                                                          **Notice at the moment this parameter is not functional
                                                            in LoadCastep**

                                               "coord" - equilibrium position of atom in Angstroms;
                                                         it has a form of numpy array with three floats

                                               "mass" - mass of atom

              The attributes should be a dictionary with the following entries:

                        "hash"  - hash of a file with the phonon data. It should be a string representation of hash.

                        "DFT_program" - name of the DFT program which was used to obtain phonon data (for CASTEP ->
                                        CASTEP).

                        "filename" - name of input DFT file

          For more details about these fields please look at the documentation of IOmodule class.
