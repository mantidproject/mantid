# Note that this a workaround
# When introduced? During the Python2 to Python3 conversion
# Why introduced? The autogenerated file ui_XXX.py contains a line
#                 from XXXX import YYYY
#                 which should be
#                 from .XXXX import YYYY
#                 for Python3, but since it is autogenerated we cannot change
#                 this easily.
