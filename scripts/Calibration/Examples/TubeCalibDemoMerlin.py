Tube Calibration Demonstration program for MERLIN.

.. attention::

  MERLIN instruments are loaded with already calibrated values. The calibration works nicelly with these files,
  but if you want to see the uncalibrated file you can do it.
  Look at `How to reset detectors calibration <http://www.mantidproject.org/How_to_reset_detectors_calibration>`_.

In this example, the calibration of the whole MERLIN instrument is shown. It demonstrate how to
use :py:func:`tube.calibrate` to calibrate MERLIN tubes.

Opening the calibrated data in the Instrument View, it is possible to group the tubes in some
common regions:

* Doors 9 and 8 are similar and can be calibrated together using 7 key points
* Doors 7,6,5,4, 2 and 1 can be calibrated using 9 key points.
* Door 3 is particular, because it is formed with some smaller tubes as well as some large tubes.


This example shows:

 * How to calibrate regions of the instrument separetelly.
 * How to use **calibTable** parameter to append information in order to create a calibration table for the whole instrument.
 * How to use the **outputPeak** to check how the calibration is working as well as the usage of analisePeakTable method to
       look into the details of the operation to improve the calibration.
 * It deals with defining different known positions for the different tube lengths.


The output of this examples shows an improvement in relation to the previous calibrated instrument.
