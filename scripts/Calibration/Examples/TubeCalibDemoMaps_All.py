Tube Calibration Demonstration for MAPS instrument.

This module group many examples and also demonstrate how to work with
the :func:`tube.calibrate`.

It starts from the simplest way to perform a calibration. It them increase the complexity
of dealing with real calibration work, when particularities of the instrument must be considered

At the end, it gives a suggestion on a techinique to investigate and improve the calibration itself.

    tubes whose calibration was not so good.

    This method explores how to deal with these tubes.

    First of all, it is important to identify the tubes that did not work well.

    From the outputs of provideTheExpectedValue, looking inside the instrument tree,
    it is possible to list all the tubes that are not so good.

    Unfortunately, they do not have a single name identifier.
    So, locating them it is a little bit trickier.
    The :func:`~Examples.findThoseTubesThatNeedSpecialCareForCalibration` shows one way of finding those
    tubes.     The index is the position inside the PeakTable.

    For this example, we have used inspection from the Instrument View.
    One of them is inside the A1_Window, 3rd PSD_TUBE_STRIP 8 pack up, 4th PSD_TUBE_STRIP: Index = 8+8+4 - 1 = 19.

    In this example, we will ask the calibration to run the calibration only for 3 tubes
    (indexes 18,19,20). Them, we will check why the 19 is not working well. Finally, we will try to
    provide another peaks position for this tube,
    and run the calibration again for these tubes, to improve the results.
