# TUBE CALIBRATION DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM FOR MERLIN
#
# This is a simple example for running calibration for and calibration run of MERLIN.
# It uses the CalibrateMerlin Function
#
# Here we run the calibration of MERLIN or selected part of MERLIN
# (excluding short tubes of door 3)
# This calibration is organised by the function CalibrateMerlin,
# which takes a string consisting of the run number of a calibration run number as argument.
# The workspace with calibrated instrument is saved to a Nexus file
#

    ##
    ## for merlin: npixels = 1024
