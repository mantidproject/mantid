# This class is the ideal tube, which specifies where the peaks formed by slits or edges should occur

class IdealTube(object):
    """
   The IdealTube specifies where the peaks formed by slits or edges should occur.

   They can be considered as the known positions as well.
   It does also keep informatin about the shape of the known_positions, if they are
   peaks or edges.

   First you create an ideal tube by calling the empty constructor idealTube().
   Then call another function to populate it.

   You may fill it up with the following methods:

    * :meth:`~ideal_tube.IdealTube.setArray`
    * :meth:`~ideal_tube.IdealTube.setPositionsAndForm`

   You may than query the known positions and functional forms through :

    * :meth:`~ideal_tube.IdealTube.getArray`
    * :meth:`~ideal_tube.IdealTube.getFunctionalForms`
