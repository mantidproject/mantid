"""
The aim of this file is to change the way in which we pass settings around
between reduction steps.  The benefits to this new method are as follows:

1) Settings become easily transferrable between the C++/Python layers.
   Previously, the only way for the GUI to get/set variables in the reducer
   was to do something like:

   QString var = runPythonScript("print i.ReductionSingleton().step.var");
   double num = var.toDouble()
   runPythonScript("i.ReductionSingleton().step.var = " + value_from_user);

   This becomes:

   double num = settings.getProperty("step_var");
   settings.setProperty("step_var", value_from_user);

   which is good since:

   a) it reduces the amount of boilerplate code;
   b) no Python scripts have to be run; and
   c) we get the type-casting and checking of the PropertyManager for free.

2) It promotes decoupling of the ReductionStep objects.  Previously, the
   only way to pass information between reduction steps was to either:

   a) store the information as variables inside the reducer; or
   b) store the information as variables inside the reduction steps.

   The problem with a) is that things get very messy very quickly when we
   have lots of variables, and the downside of b) is that we have to write
   code like:

      needed_value = reducer.some_other_reduction_step_object.variable

   leaving us with a web of interconnected objects, which defeats the point
   of having separate ReductionStep objects in the first place.

3) Decoupled objects are far easier to unit test.  Previously, the only way
   we could start unit testing would be to set up a "mock" object for every
   other step our to-be-tested ReductionStep required information from:

   class MockReductionStep1:
       var = 100

   class MockReductionStep2:
       var = "value"

   class MockReducer:
       step1 = MockReductionStep1
       step2 = MockReductionStep2

   def test_step():
       step_to_be_tested = ReductionStep()
       step_to_be_tested.execute(MockReducer())

   This would now be done by simply setting the pre-requisite information
   of the ReductionStep in the PropertyManager.

4) It gets us slightly nearer to the "modern" way of way of reducing data
   in Mantid, namely "workflow" algorithms which call child algorithms,
   passing settings to each other via PropertyManager objects.

        Pickling has not been enabled for PropertyManager, and this is needed
        in the Reducer so that the "deep copy" stuff does not complain.  This
        is a workaround where we wrap the functionality of PropertyManager that
        we're interested in and internally just retrieve an instance of the
        manager every time the wrapper is used.

        Also take this opportunity to change typed property-getting to the
        simpler "[]" operator rather than getProperty().value.
