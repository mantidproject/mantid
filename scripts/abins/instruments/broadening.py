def broaden_spectrum(frequencies, bins, s_dft, sigma, scheme='gaussian_truncated'):
    """Convert frequency/S data to broadened spectrum on a regular grid

    Several algorithms are implemented, for purposes of
    performance/accuracy optimisation and demonstration of legacy
    behaviour.

    :param frequencies: input frequency series; these may be irregularly spaced
    :type frequencies: 1D array-like
    :param bins:
        Evenly-spaced frequency bin values for the output spectrum. If *frequencies* is None, s_dft is assumed to
        correspond to mid-point frequencies on this mesh.
    :type bins: 1D array-like
    :param s_dft: scattering values corresponding to *frequencies*
    :type s_dft: 1D array-like
    :param sigma:
        width of broadening function. This should be a scalar used over the whole spectrum, or a series of values
        corresponding to *frequencies*.
    :type sigma: float or 1D array-like
    :param scheme:
        Name of broadening method used. Options:

        - none: Return the input data as a histogram, ignoring the value of sigma
        - gaussian: Evaluate a Gaussian on the output grid for every input point and sum them. Simple but slow, and
              recommended only for benchmarking and reference calculations.
        - normal: Generate histograms with appropriately-located normal distributions for every input point. In
              principle this is more accurate than 'Gaussian' but in practice results are very similar and just as slow.
        - gaussian_truncated: Gaussians are cut off at a range of 3 * max(sigma). This leads to small discontinuities in
              the tails of the broadened peaks, but is _much_ faster to evaluate as all the broadening functions are the
              same (limited) size. Recommended for production calculations.
        - normal_truncated: As gaussian_truncated, but with normally-distributed histograms replacing Gaussian evaluation.
              Results are marginally more accurate at a marginally increased cost.
        - interpolate: A possibly-novel approach in which the spectrum broadened with a frequency-dependent kernel is
              approximated by interpolation between a small set of spectra broadened with logarithmically-spaced
              fixed-width kernels. In principle this method introduces an incorrect asymmetry to the peaks. In practice
              the results are visually acceptable for a slowly-varying instrumental broadening function, with greatly
              reduced computation time. The default spacing factor of sqrt(2) gives error of ~1%.
        - interpolate_coarse: The approximate interpolative scheme (above) with a spacing factor of 2, which yields
              error of ~5%. This is more likely to cause artefacts in the results... but it is very fast. Not recomended
              for production calculations.

    """Return a fast estimate of frequency-dependent broadening

    Consider a spectrum of two peaks, in the case where (as in indirect-geometry INS) the peak width
    increases with frequency.

       |
       |        |
       |        |
    -----------------

    In the traditional scheme we broaden each peak individually and combine:

       *                      |                       *
       *        |       +     |        *       =      *        *
      * *       |             |      *   *           * *     *   *
    -----------------      -----------------       -----------------

    Instead of summing over broadening kernels evaluated at each peak, the approximate obtains
    a spectrum corresponding to the following scheme:

    - For each sigma value, the entire spectrum is convolved with an
      appropriate-width broadening function
    - At each frequency, the final spectrum value is drawn from the spectrum
      broadened with corresponding sigma.

    Compared to a summation over broadened peaks, this method introduces an
    asymmetry to the spectrum about each peak.

       *                    *                    *                         *
       *        *          * *       *          * *       *      -->       **       *
      * *       *         *   *     * *       *     *   *   *             *  *     *  *
    ----------------- ,  ----------------- ,  -----------------         -----------------

    This asymmetry should be tolerable as long as the broadening function
    varies slowly in frequency relative to its width.

    The benefit of this scheme is that we do not need to evaluate the
    convolution at every sigma value; nearby spectra can be interpolated.
    Trial-and-error finds that with optimal mixing the error of a Gaussian
    approximated by mixing a wider and narrower Gaussian is ~ 5% when the sigma
    range is factor of 2, and ~ 1% when the sigma range is a factor of sqrt(2).
    A pre-optimised transfer function can be used for a fixed ratio between the
    reference functions.
