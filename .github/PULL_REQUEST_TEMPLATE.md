##### Code Review #####

- [ ] Is the code of an acceptable quality?
- [ ] Does the code conform to the [coding standards](http://www.mantidproject.org/Coding_Standards)? Is it well structured with small focussed classes/methods/functions?
- [ ] Are there unit/system tests in place? Are the unit tests small and test the a class in isolation?
- [ ] If there are changes in the release notes then do they describe the changes appropriately?

##### Functional Tests #####

- [ ] How do the changes handle unexpected situations, e.g. bad input?
- [ ] Has the relevant documentation been added/updated?
- [ ] Is user-facing documentation written in a user-friendly manner?
