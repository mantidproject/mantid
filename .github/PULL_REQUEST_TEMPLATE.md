#### Reviewer ####

Please comment on the following ([full description](http://www.mantidproject.org/Individual_Ticket_Testing)):

##### Code Review #####

- [ ] Is the code of an acceptable quality?
- [ ] Does the code conform to the coding standards? Is it well structured with small focussed classes/methods/functions?
- [ ] Are there unit/system tests in place? Are the unit tests small and test the a class in isolation?
- [ ] If there are changes in the release notes then do they describe the changes appropriately?

##### Functional Tests #####

- [ ] Do changes function as described? Add comments below that describe the tests performed?
- [ ] How do the changes handle unexpected situations, e.g. bad input?
- [ ] Has the relevant documentation been added/updated?
- [ ] Is user-facing documentation written in a user-friendly manner?
- [ ] Has developer documentation been updated if required?

- Does everything look good? Comment with the ship it emoji but don't merge. A member of `@mantidproject/gatekeepers` will take care of it.
