            This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
            activity in 6 months. It will be closed in 7 days if no further activity occurs.

            Allowing issues to close as stale helps us filter out issues which can wait
            for future development time. All issues closed by stale bot act like normal issues; they can be searched for, commented on or reopened at any point.

            If you'd like a closed stale issue to be considered,
            feel free to either re-open the issue directly or contact a developer.

            it helps us see that this is still affecting you and you want
            it fixed in the near-future. Extending the lifetime of an issue
            may cause the development team to prioritise it over other issues,
            which may be closed as stale instead.
