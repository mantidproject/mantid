/**\brief Handler for modifying one or more QWidget and/or QwtPlotMarker with
 *mouse or keyboard.
 *
 * During initialization, the SelectionMoveResizer adds itself as a new child
 *widget to
 * the target's parentWidget() or QwtPlotCanvas. Because Qt 4.1 and beyond
 *propagate a widget's
 * background by default, frame and resize handlers can then simply be drawn on
 *top of
 * the usual content of the parent.
 * Also, the SelectionMoveResizer gets to see mouse and key events first without
 *the need to filter
 * events for its parent.
 * %Note however that the latter must still be done in order to catch geometry
 *changes and
 * stay the same size as the parent.
 *
 * At every point in time, the list of managed targets must be non-empty,
 * so that the SelectionMoveResizer has a well-defined bounding rectangle.
 * When there are no more selected targets, it deletes itself, so references to
 *a SelectionMoveResizer
 * should be maintained by QPointer and checked for validity before use.
 *
 * QWidget targets are automatically removed when they are deleted (possibly
 *also deleting the
 * SelectionMoveResizer), using the QObject::destroyed() signal. With
 *QwtPlotMarker, this is not
 * possible since it's not a QObject. Thus, care has to be taken to remove them
 *before or shortly after deletion,
 * lest the wrath of Segmentation Fault shall come upon you.
 *
 * \section design Design Ideas
 *   - Keep as much of the select/move/resize code as possible in one class to
 *ease maintanance.
 *   - Use the same class for layer and marker handling to avoid duplicating
 *code.
 *     Good for bugfixing and for maintaining a consistent user interface.
 *   - Keep this class generic so that it can later be used for other parents
 *     (than MultiLayer's canvas QWidget and Plot's QwtPlotCanvas)
 *     and/or targets (e.g. new QwtPlotMarker subclasses) with little to no
 *modifications.
 *   - Differentiate between move/resize, which are generic operations, and
 *editing (like moving the
 *     endpoints of a ArrowMarker), which requires detailed knowledge about the
 *target.
 *     This way, new types of markers or MultiLayer children support
 *moving/resizing without further
 *     work. Editing can then be implemented in the targets themselves, as shown
 *in ArrowMarker.
 *   .
 *
 * \section future Future Plans
 * See the documentation of ImageMarker for ideas about replacing QwtPlotMarker
 *with a new QwtPlotItem subclass.
 * For SelectionMoveResizer this would mean supporting new enrichments without
 *modifications and being able
 * to automatically remove them upon deletion (if the new class inherits
 *QObject).
 * Not to mention that the implementation would be a lot cleaner if we would
 *only have to handle two target classes
 * instead of four.
 *
 * Think about turning SelectionMoveResizer into an input method for general
 *affine transformations.
 * Particularly, this would add rotation, flipping and shearing.
 * Markers could implement this using QPainter's coordinate transformations.
 * Definitely not a priority, though.
