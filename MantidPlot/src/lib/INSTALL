Introduction
============

Qti uses qmake to build all its components and examples. 
qmake is part of a Qt distribution. 

qmake reads project files, that contain the options and rules how to 
build a certain project. A project file ends with the suffix "*.pro". 

You need Qt4 and Qwt 5.1 installed on your system.

A) Unix Qt4
==========================

qmake
make

If you have installed a shared library it's path has to be known to 
the run-time linker of your operating system. On Linux systems read
"man ldconfig" ( or google for it ). Another option is to use
the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (on some systems LIBPATH is used instead, on MacOSX
it is called DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH) environment variable.

B) Win32/MSVC Qt4
=====================

Please read the qmake documentation how to convert 
your *.pro files into your development environment.

F.e MSVC with nmake:
qmake qti.pro
nmake

C) Win32/MinGW Qt4
==================
qmake qti.pro
make
