/**\brief Plot tool for calculating intensity profiles of image markers along a
 *line.
 *
 * It is assumed that on the parent Graph an ImageMarker is selected. During
 *initialization,
 * a pointer to this marker is stored and the selection is removed. The
 *LineProfileTool
 * adds itself as a full-sized child widget to the Graph's canvas, allowing for
 *fast redraws
 * while selection of the line is in progress. Once the line is selected (mouse
 *button is
 * released), the profile is calculate and displayed, a new LineMarker denoting
 *the selected
 * profile line is added to the Graph and the LineProfileTool deletes itself by
 *setting the
 * Graph's active tool to NULL.
 *
 * \section future Future Plans
 * Actually, image analysis doesn't fit terribly well into the Graph framework.
 * A cleaner approach would be to add a new MyWidget subclass (Image?) that
 *operates on a single
 * image, providing things like line profiles, intensity tables and measuring
 *points on scanned graphs
 * (simple <a href="http://www.frantz.fi/software/g3data.php">g3data</a>-like
 *functionality).
 * There could be facilities for making an Image from an ImageMarker and vice
 *versa
 * (if that's really needed).
 * [ postponed until after the redesign of project handling ]
