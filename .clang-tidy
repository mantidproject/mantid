# Skip the following family of checks (for perf as we don't touch these libs at all):
# abseil-*
# android-*
# altera-*
# fuchsia-*
# llvmlibc-*
# objc-*

# The following checks are additionally disabled above:
# -google-build-using-namespace                 Useful for headers, but we can't filter out .cpp where it's used frequently

# -google-readability-braces-around-statements  We use if blocks without braces throughout
# -readability-braces-around-statements         Ditto
# -hicpp-braces-around-statements               Ditto

# -modernize-use-trailing-return-type           We use the old style throughout

# -readability-implicit-bool-conversion         Allow if(!ptr) rather than (ptr==nullptr)
