// suppress specific rule in specific files
// NOTE this needs the full path to the file, so would need this file to be generated by cmake
//      as different build servers have different starts to the file path

// -------- Project Wide ------------------

// Hide warnings about using explicit keyword constructors as we have "too many"
// and automated clang-tidy breaks a couple of implicit conversions we use widely
noExplicitConstructor

// Hide warnings about shadowed members for inheritance. Typically "m_log" with Algorithm
duplInheritedMember

// Hide unused functions, cppcheck does not consider headers, so many Qt overrides
// called by Qt will be marked as unused
unusedFunction

// We have some potentially uninitialized member vars but too many to fix at the moment
uninitMemberVar

// Around 100 of these exist where noConstructor is present
noConstructor

// Pre-processor Directives, such as #error, which are upstream anyway
preprocessorErrorDirective

// Cppcheck struggles with some inheritance chains, some of these might be true though
unusedPrivateFunction

// Since 2.13 Cppcheck reports how many checkers are used.
checkersReport

// ----------------- Upstream libs ---------------

// All ANN files as they are upstream anyway
*:*${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/Framework/Kernel/src/ANN/*

// ----------- New list of suppressions after updating to cppcheck 2.13.1 -------------
// - If the line number changes then update it here, or resolve the defect and remove from list
