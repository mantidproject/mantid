// suppress specific rule in specific files
// NOTE this needs the full path to the file, so would need this file to be generated by cmake
//      as different build servers have different starts to the file path
// Example:
// memsetClassFloat:/Users/builder/Jenkins/workspace/cppcheck-1.72/Framework/DataHandling/src/LoadRaw/isisraw.h


// suppress in all files - BE CAREFUL not to leave trailing spaces after the rule id. or empty lines
// For a library this is not a problem per se
// unusedFunction
// cppcheck has problems handling the number of pre-processor definitions used in the DLL_EXPORTs
class_X_Y
// the exported functions are not used in the cpp land
unusedFunction:Framework/PythonInterface/mantid/*/src/Exports/*.cpp
