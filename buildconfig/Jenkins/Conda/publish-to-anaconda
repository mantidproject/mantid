# Expected args:
#   1. WORKSPACE: path to the workspace/source code that this should run inside
#                 (mantid repo). Windows Caveat: Only use / for this argument do
#                 not use \\ or \ in the path.
#   2. TOKEN: Token for uploading to anaconda.org
#   3. CHANNEL: Channel to upload to
#   4. LABEL: The label used when uploading to anaconda
#   5. PACKAGES: A list of args that will be uploaded to anaconda cloud.
