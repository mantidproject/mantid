#
# Example command to run a PR build on ubuntu:
# conda-pre-commit pull_requests-cppcheck ${WORKSPACE}
#
# Expected args:
#   1. WORKSPACE: path to the workspace/source code that this should run inside, Windows Caveat: Only use / for
#                 this argument do not use \\ or \ in the path.
#   2. GIT_COMMIT_SHA: SHA of the commit to compare with the base when checking diffs
