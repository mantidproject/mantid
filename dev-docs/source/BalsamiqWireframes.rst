Mockups with Balsamiq Wireframes
================================

This page provides a brief introduction to mockups with Balsamiq Wireframes.

Overview
--------

Mockups are very useful in the early phases of software development. They can be utilised for capturing requirements as well as getting feedback from the user. Usually the focus lies
on the structure of a UI and interactions between different elements of a UI.
Mockup tools help to create mockups with different levels of detail, from a rough sketch to very detailed requirements. Balsamiq Wireframes is a mockup tool that allows you to quickly
sketch UIs. It is essentially a collection of the most commonly used widgets for a variety of UI types. The user can arrange these widgets in a drag-and-drop editor which is often
much faster than drawing a mockup by hand.

Balsamiq mockups always have an unfinished look and feel to them. This is actually intended for several reasons. It encourages the user to give honest feedback as they might not feel
that a lot of work has to be redone to include the suggested changes. Even more important, the mockup is not mistaken for the finished product. None will assume that it is a
screenshot of the final version and most of the code behind it already written.

With the cloud version of Balsamiq Wireframes several users can work together on the same mockup.
