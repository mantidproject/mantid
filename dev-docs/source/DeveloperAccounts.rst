Unique Profiles
---------------

Simple, easy to recognise user names are preferred. For example "Martyn Gigg", or if spaces are not allowed "MartynGigg".

Also, add your own unique and fun profile image on Slack, Github, the Forum and everywhere to make you more recognisable. Many people choose a pet, cartoon or something they're obsessed with, such as tea!
