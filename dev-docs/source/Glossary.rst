    Detector ID
        A unique integer associated with each :term:`pixel <Pixel>` in the instrument.
        Apart from uniqueness, detector-id integer values are arbitrary.  For example, they are not required to be consecutive,
        and negative values may be used to indicate pixels with a special function, such as monitor pixels.

    Pixel
        The smallest physical sensing element for particle-flux measurement.
        Detector panels are comprised of pixels.
