# Final Exercise

Now that the view and the model are complete all that is left to do is
bring it all together in our presenter. In this exercise you will need
to create three presenters.

1.  A presenter to interact with `View`, setting the allowed colour
    options from the [Colour Converter](ColourConverter) model and getting the values from
    your table.
2.  A presenter to interact with [Plot View](PlotView), passing x and y values from
    the [Plot Model](PlotModel) model to be plotted.
3.  A presenter to interact with [Main View](MainView) and `Model` directly and
    calling functions in your other presenters.

See [here](CompleteGUI) for the solution and complete functioning GUI.
