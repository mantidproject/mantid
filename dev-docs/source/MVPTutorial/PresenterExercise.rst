==================
Presenter Exercise
==================

In this exercise you will create a presenter for ``view.py.``

Using the view from the previous exercise (the one which contains a
table) create a presenter to handle the button press. When the button
is pressed the following should be output:

- The line colour
- If the grid lines are on or off
- The frequency
- The phase

The ``main`` module will also need updating to handle these changes.

See :ref:`here <PresenterExerciseSolution>` for the solution.
