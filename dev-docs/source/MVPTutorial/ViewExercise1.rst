View Exercise 1
===============

A GUI should help a user to easily manipulate the behaviour of the
code (by changing variables etc.). For example consider creating a
plot of a sine wave. In this exercise you will create a view which
contains the options for manipulating the plot.

The GUI should contain a single table and a button for updating the
plot. The table should include options for:

- Setting the line colour (red, blue, green)
- Setting the grid lines
- Entering a frequency
- Entering a phase shift

The previous sections are not an exhaustive list of possible widgets.

The pages :ref:`Matplotlib and MVP <Matplotlib>` and :ref:`MultipleView
<MultipleViews>` will be useful for the exercise.

The solution can be found :ref:`here <ViewExercise1Solution>`.
