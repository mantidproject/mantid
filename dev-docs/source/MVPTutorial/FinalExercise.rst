Final Exercise
==============

Now that the view and the model are complete all that is left to do is
bring it all together in our presenter. In this exercise you will need
to create three presenters.

1. A presenter to interact with ``view``, setting the allowed colour
   options from the ``ColourConverter`` model and getting the values
   from your table.
2. A presenter to interact with ``plot_view``, passing x and y values
   from the ``DataGenerator`` model to be plotted.
3. A presenter to interact with ``master_view`` and ``model`` directly
   and calling functions in your other presenters.

See :ref:`here <CompleteGUI>` for the solution and complete functioning
GUI.
