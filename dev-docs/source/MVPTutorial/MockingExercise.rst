================
Mocking Exercise
================

In this exercise you will mock the Presenter from the `Presenter
Exercise <PresenterExercise.html>`_. All of the methods should be
mocked and the return values should be present only when necessary (on
this occasion the values do not matter). The ``updatePlot`` function
should be tested to make sure that it calls the correct methods.

See :ref:`here <MockingExerciseSolution>` for the solution.
