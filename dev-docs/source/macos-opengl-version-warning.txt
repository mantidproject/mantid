.. note::

   macOS developers will see the warning from Qt in the terminal:

   ``An OpenGL surfcace format was requested that is either not version 3.2 or higher or a not Core Profile.``
   ``Chromium on macOS will fall back to software rendering in this case.``
   ``Hardware acceleration and features such as WebGL will not be available.``

   It can be safely ignored but is present as a reminder of some deprecated OpenGL
   functionality being used.
   It is only visible to developers and the spelling mistake is real.
