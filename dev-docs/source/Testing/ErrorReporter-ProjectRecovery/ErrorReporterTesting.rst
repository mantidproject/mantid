Error Reporter test
-------------------

*Preparation*

- Ensure that `Report usage data` is checked in the First Time Setup screen
- Below you will be asked to produce a hard crash (by running the `Segfault`
  Algorithm) or a soft crash (bring up an error report pop-up without also
  closing Mantid, by Loading ``Training_Exercise3a_SNS.nxs`` available from
  the `Training Course Data <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mantid/files/Sample%20Data/TrainingCourseData.zip/download>`__
  and running the `NormaliseToMonitor` Algorithm. If one or both of these
  methods to crash Mantid no longer works, then ask other developers for a
  suitable method and update these instructions.
- Make sure the location of this file is included in your search directories. Full instructions :ref:`are available online <mantid:getting started>`.
- These tests should be run with someone who has access to the error reports database. Please contact Daniel Murphy when you are going to run these tests.
