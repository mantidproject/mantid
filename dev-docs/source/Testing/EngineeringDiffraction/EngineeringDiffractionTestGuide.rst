Preamble
^^^^^^^^^
This document is tailored towards developers intending to test the Engineering Diffraction
interface.

Runs can be loaded from the archive, however it is possible that different run numbers
will be needed as older runs may be deleted.

Overview
^^^^^^^^
The Engineering Diffraction interface allows scientists using the EnginX instrument to interactively
process their data. There are 4 tabs in total. These are:

- Calibration - This is where a cerium oxide run is entered to calibrate the subsequent data.
- Focus - Where are the data across multiple spectra are normalised and summed into a single spectrum for later steps.
- Fitting - Where peaks can be fitted on focused data
- GSAS II - Run a basic refinement on the `GSASIIscriptable API <https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GSASIIscriptable.html>`_

Especially to aide GSASII testing, please test on an ENGINX IDAaaS instance.

The tests are designed to be run from a starting point where no settings relating to the Engineering Diffraction Gui
have been saved in the Mantid Workbench ini file. This file is in ``C:\Users\<fed id>\AppData\Roaming\mantidproject`` on
Windows and ``~/.config/mantidproject/`` on linux. To ensure there are no saved settings open up the file mantidworkbench.ini
and delete the settings with names starting with EngineeringDiffraction2 from the CustomInterfaces section

Test 1
^^^^^^
This test follows the simple steps for calibrating and focusing in the Engineering Diffraction Gui.

Calibration
-----------

1. Ensure you can access the ISIS data archive.

2. Open the Engineering Diffraction gui: ``Interfaces`` > ``Diffraction`` > ``Engineering Diffraction``

3. On opening the gui the `Create New Calibration` option should be selected.

4. Open the settings dialog from the cog in the bottom left of the gui.

5. Set the `Save Location` to a directory of your choice.

6. Check that the `Full Calibration` setting has a default path to a .nxs file (currently ENGINX_full_instrument_calibration_193749.nxs)

7. Close the settings window

8. For the `Calibration Sample #` enter 305738.

9. Tick the `Plot Calibrated Workspace` option.

10. Click `Calibrate`, after completing calibration it should produce the following plot.

11. Check that in your save location there is a Calibration folder containing three .prm files
    `ENGINX_305738` with the suffixes `_all_banks`, `_bank_1`, `_bank_2`.

12. Close the Engineering Diffraction gui and reopen it. The `Load Existing Calibration` radio
    button should be checked on the Calibration tab and the path should be populated with the
    `_all_banks.prm` file generated earlier in this test.

13. In the `Load Existing Calibration` box browse to the `_bank_2.prm` file and click the `Load` button.

Focus
-----

1. Change to the Focus tab.

2. For the `Sample Run #` use 305761 and for the `Vanadium #` enter 307521.

3. Tick the `Plot Focused Workspace` option and click `Focus`. It should produce a plot of a single spectrum for bank 2.

4. Go back to the Calibration tab and load in an existing calibration for both banks e.g. `ENGINX_305738_all_banks.prm`

5. Go back to the Focus tab and click `Focus`, after completing calibration it should produce a plot.

    :width: 900px

6. Check that in your save location there is a Focus folder containing the following files:
   - `ENGINX_305761_307521_bank_1_dSpacing.nxs`, `ENGINX_305761_307521_bank_2_dSpacing.nxs`, `ENGINX_305761_307521_bank_1_TOF.nxs` and `ENGINX_305761_307521_bank_2_TOF.nxs` (i.e. two files, for the xunits TOF and d-Spacing, per spectrum)
   - `ENGINX_305761_307521_all_banks.gss` and `ENGINX_305761_307521_all_banks.abc` (i.e. two ASCII files per run - each file contains all the spectra for a focused run).

Test 2
^^^^^^

This test covers the RB number.

1. Enter a string into the `RB Number` box.

2. Follow the steps of Test 1, any output files (for non-texture ROI) should now be located in both
   [Save location]/user/[RB number] and [Save location] (for texture ROI the files will be saved in the first location
   if an RB number is specified, otherwise they will be saved in the latter - this is to reduce the number of files being written).


Test 3
^^^^^^

This test covers the Cropping functionality in the Calibration tab.

1. Change the RB Number to `North`, this is purely to separate the cropped output files into their own space.

2. Go to the Calibration tab, select `Create New Calibration` and tick the Crop Calibration option. In the drop down `Region of Interest` select `1 (North)`.

3. Check the `Plot Calibrated Workspace` checkbox and click calibrate.

4. The generated figure should show a plot of TOF vs d-spacing and plot showing residuals of the quadratic fit.

5. Check that only one .prm and one .nxs output file was generated.

6. Go to focus tab and click `Focus`.

7. Change the RB number to `Custom`.

8. Set the ``Region Of Interest`` to ``Crop to Spectra`` and using ``Custom Spectra`` ``1200-1400`` (these spectrum numbers correspond to the South Bank).
   Please note that some custom spectra values may cause the algorithms to fail. Click ``Calibrate`` and a similar plot to before should appear but with only 2 subplots.

9. Set the ``Region of Interest`` to ``Texture (20 spec)`` - there should be 20 spectra per run (5 tiled plot windows, 4 spectra per window).


Test 4
^^^^^^

This test covers the loading and plotting focused data in the fitting tab.

0. Create a new calibration, untick ``Crop calibration`` enter calibration sample # ``305738`` and click Calibrate.
   On the ``Focus`` tab, set ``Sample Run #`` to ``305793-305795`` and ``Vanadium #`` to ``307521`` and click ``Focus``. These sample runs have different stress and strain log values.

1. In the fitting tab, load multiple of these newly focused TOF .nxs files in the `Load Focused Data` section. The path to the focused files should be auto populated

2. Click the `Load` button. A row should be added to the UI table for each focused run.There should be a grouped workspace with the suffix `_logs` in the ADS with tables corresponding to each log value specified in the settings (to open the settings use the cog in the bottom left corner of the UI). Each row in these tables should correspond to the equivalent row in the UI table. There should be an additional table called `run_info` that provides some of the metadata for each run.

3. The log values that are averaged can be selected in the settings (cog button in the bottom left corner of the UI). Change which sample log checkboxes are selected. Close settings and then close and re-open the Engineering Diffraction interface.
   Reopen settings to check these selected sample logs have been remembered. Note that any change to the selected logs won't take effect until the interface is reopened.

4. Repeat steps 1-2 above but this time try checking the `Add To Plot` checkbox, when loading the run(s) the data should now be plotted and the checkbox in the `Plot` column of the UI table should be checked.

5. Repeat steps 1-2 again but load the d-spacing .nxs file(s) instead

6. Plot some data and un-dock the plot in the UI by dragging or double-clicking the bar at the top of the plot labelled `Fit Plot`. The plot can now be re-sized.

7. To dock it double click the `Fit Plot` bar (or drag to the bottom of the toolbar). You may want to un-dock it again for subsequent tests.

Test 5
^^^^^^

This tests the removal of focused runs from the fitting tab.

1. Load multiple runs using the `Browse` button. This should take you to a folder called "Focus" containing .nxs files that have been previously generated from the Focus tab. Select multiple files and click on `Open`

2. Having loaded multiple runs, select a row in the UI table and then click the `Remove Selected` button below the table. The row should be removed, if the run was plotted it will disappear from the plot and there should be one less row in each of the table workspaces inside the "_logs" workspace group with each row corresponding to the run in the same row of the UI table. The workspaces called "ENGINX\_...._TOF" and "ENGINX\_...._TOG_bgsub" will be deleted from the ADS

3. Try clicking the `Remove All` button, the UI table should be empty and the workspace group with name ending "_logs" should no longer be present.

4. Try loading in a run again, the UI should still be able to access the workspace and remember the log values - check there are no calls to ``AverageLogData`` in the log (should be visible at notice level).

5. Try removing a workspace by deleting it in the ADS, the corresponding row in the log tables and the UI table should have been removed.

Test 6
^^^^^^

This tests that the background subtraction works.

1. Load in a run - the `Subtract BG` box should be checked in the UI table by default. This should generate a workspace with suffix `_bg` and the data should look like the background is flat and roughly zero on the plot using the default parameters (other columns in the UI table).

2. Select the row in the table and check the `Inspect Background` button should now be enabled regardless of whether the `Subtract BG` box is checked.

3. Click  `Inspect Background` to open a new figure which shows the raw data, the background and the subtracted data. Changing the values of Niter, BG, XWindow and SG (input to ``EnggEstimateFocussedBackground``, hover over a cell in the table to see a tool tip for explanation) should produce a change in the background on the external plot and in the UI plot.

Test 7
^^^^^^

This tests the operation of the fit browser.

1. Check that when no data are plotted the `Fit` button on the toolbar does nothing.

2. Check the Browse Filter combobox is set to ``TOF`` and click Browse. In the ``Focus`` folder of the save directory, there should be output focussed TOF files.
   Select multiple focussed files and click Open. Back on the main interface, check the box ``Add to Plot`` and click ``Load``.

3. Click the `Fit` button in the plot toolbar. A simplified version of the standard mantid fit property browser should now be visible.

4. In the fit property browser, all the plotted spectra should be available in the Settings > Workspace combo box.
   In the central ``Run Selection`` table, remove one spectrum from the plot by unticking the ``Plot`` checkbox for one row.
   The Settings > Workspace combo box should now update and not include the removed spectrum.

5. Right-click on the plot image and select Add Peak and add a peak to the plot. Change the peak type and add another peak. Also add a Linear background.
   Make sure to add a BackToBackExponential peak if you have not already. For BackToBackExponential peaks, the A and B parameters should be fixed automatically for ENGIN-X data.

6. Perform a fit by clicking ``Fit > Fit`` in the fit browser. On completion of the fit, a group workspace with suffix `_fits` should have appeared in the Workspaces Toolbox(ADS).
   In this group of workspaces there should be a matrix workspace for each parameter fitted (named by convention FunctionName_ParameterName), to view this right-click on the workspace
   and `Show Data`. Any runs not fit will have a NaN value in the Y and E fields. In addition there is a workspace that has converted any peak centres from TOF to d-spacing (suffix `_d`).
   There should be an additional table called `model` that summarises the chisq value and the function string including the best-fit parameters.

7. In the Fit property browser, go to ``Setup > Custom Setup``. The function string, including the best-fit parameters, should also have been automatically saved
   as a custom setup. Select ``Setup > Clear Model``, then select this new custom setup model. Inspect the fit by clicking Fit > Evaluate Function.

Test 8
^^^^^^

This tests the sequential fitting capability of the UI (where the result of a fit to one workspace is used as the initial guess for the next).

0. In the main workbench window, right-click on the Message log and set the Log Level to ``Notice``.

1. Close and re-open the Engineering Diffraction interface.

2. Create a new calibration, untick ``Crop calibration`` enter calibration sample # ``305738`` and click Calibrate.

3. Enter the Engineering Diffraction settings menu by clicking the cog wheel in the bottom left. In the Fitting Settings section,
   you can select which sample logs to output to table workspaces, the Primary Log for Sequential fit ordering, and whether this should be in ascending or descending order.
   In the primary log combobox, select ``ADC1_0`` and tick ``Ascending``.

4. On the ``Focus`` tab, set ``Sample Run #`` to ``305793-305795`` and ``Vanadium #`` to ``307521`` and click ``Focus``.

5. On the Fitting tab, Load in several focused runs (preferably some that differ by a log value, e.g. 305793-305795).

6. Plot just one run, click ``Fit`` to open the fit property browser and input a valid fit function including a peak and a background.

7. The `Sequential Fit` button at the bottom of the ``Run Selection`` table should now be enabled.
   Click this button and a group of fit workspaces should appear in the Workspaces Toolbox (ADS), each with a row for each of the runs in the table. All the runs should have been fitted.

8. The order of the runs in the sequential fit should be obtainable from the log at notice level -
   check that this corresponds to the order of the average value of the primary log - ``ADC1_0``
   You can check the value of this sample log for each run in the output GroupWorkspace with the suffix ``_logs``. Note this order down.

9. Try changing the primary log to blank and re-run the ``Sequential Fit`` This should make the Sequential fit use the order of the runs in the central ``Run Selection`` table.

10. In the Engineering Diffraction settings, set the primary log back to ``ADC1_0`` and tick ``Descending``.
    Re-run the ``Sequential Fit`` and check that the order of runs in the output workspaces has reversed compared to step 8.

11. Close and re-open the Engineering Diffraction interface. Reopen the Engineering Diffraction settings menu, it should remember the primary log and the order.

Test 9
^^^^^^

This tests the serial fitting capability of the UI (where all loaded workspaces are fitted from the same starting parameters).

1. Repeat steps 1-2 in the previous test (Test 8).

2. The `Serial Fit` button should now be enabled. Click it and the group of fit workspaces should appear in the ADS, each with a row for each of the runs in the table. All the runs should have been fitted.

3. The order of the runs in the serial fit should be obtainable from the log at notice level - check that this corresponds to the order of the runs in the table.

Test 10
^^^^^^^

1. On the Fitting tab, test the functionality of the Load Focused Data section at the top. The tests so far have enabled you to produce many different focussed data files,
   so check that the Unit and region filters help you to find dSpacing data for Texture regions and TOF data for North bank.

Test 11
^^^^^^^

Note this test will only work if GSASII is also installed.
Please test this on IDAaaS: an ENGINX instance should have MantidWorkbenchNightly and GSASII installed in the expected location.

1. Close and re-open the Engineering Diffraction interface.

2. Go to the Calibration tab, select ``Create New Calibration`` and un-tick the Crop Calibration option.

3. For the ``Calibration Sample #`` enter 305738 and click the Calibrate button.

4. On the Focus tab, enter ``Sample Run #`` 305761 and ``Vanadium #`` 307521 and click the Focus button.

    :width: 600px

5. Change to the GSASII tab. The ``Instrument Group`` path should be pre-filled to a .prm file output by the calibration
   and the ``Focused Data`` path should be pre-filled to the .gss file output from the Focus tab.

6. For the ``Phase`` filepath, browse to ``MANTID_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/scripts/Engineering/ENGINX/phase_info/FE_GAMMA.cif``. For the ``Project Name`` at the top, enter a string of your choice.

7. Now, click ``Refine in GSAS II``. After a few seconds, the output fit should be plotted. In the top right of the plot widget, the refined spectrum can be changed using the combo-box.

8. Change the fitting range by dragging the limits and by editing the Min/Max line edit boxes. Again, click ``Refine in GSAS II`` and this should only fit to the user defined range.

9. Back in the file loading section, Browse for files for the inputs ``Instrument Group`` and ``Focused Data``,
   and select files with ``bank_1`` in the name, which were produced by the Calibration and Focus in Test 3.

10. Now, click ``Refine in GSAS II``. The previously set fitting range should be ignored as new input files were selected. There should now only be one spectrum available in the output spectrum combobox.

11. Set the ``Override Unit Cell Length`` to ``3.65`` and click ``Refine in GSAS II``, the fit should be better.

12. Tick all the checkboxes: ``Microstrain``, ``Sigma-1`` and ``Gamma (Y)``. An asterisk should appear with an advice tooltip.
