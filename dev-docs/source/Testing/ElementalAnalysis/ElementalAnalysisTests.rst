Introduction
------------

This document outlines some basic tests for the new elemental analysis GUI.
Please note that it is currently hidden from users.

Set up
------

To do the testing you will need some data (please request this from the ISIS spectroscopy team).
You will need to add the file location to the search paths for Mantid.

Basic tests
^^^^^^^^^^^
When the GUI starts up it will have some dummy widgets, these do not do anything.
The bottom of the GUI will have a `Manage user directories` and help buttons.
The tabs should be dockable, closing them will result in the tab returning to the docked state.
Closing the GUI should also close any undocked tabs.
