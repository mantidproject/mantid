============
Core Testing
============

These tests are performed immediately after code-freeze in preparation for a release.

The purpose of these tests is to highlight issues that the individual tests of PRs might have overlooked, or side effects to previous functionality that may have gone undetected. While performing these tests you should also report areas of poor usability and cosmetic defects.


Rules
-----

* The tests must be performed on the installer versions of the final release candidate. Not on local compiled code.
* Serious errors involving loss of functionality, crashes, regression etc. should be raised as ``High Priority`` tickets to the current iteration and an email sent to the project manager immediately.
* Minor and cosmetic issues should be raised as tickets against the next development sprint.
* First try things that should work, then try to break Mantid, e.g. entering invalid values, unexpected characters etc.

Environments
------------
The following environments must be tested, ideally at all host facilities.

- Windows 10 64bit
- Red Hat Enterprise 6 & 7  (IDAaaS at ISIS)
- Ubuntu 18.04
- Mac OS X Catalina

Grouped Tasks
=============

In order to test a wide range of functionality and avoid repeating work, areas to test are split into groups. These tasks are for testing how Workbench links to the Framework, through the different :ref:`Toolboxes <main_window>`. The links here are to give you an idea, but please mess around a little too and try to break Mantid!

This was last updated for Release 5.1. Check if the organiser has considered if the Core testers can test on different environments.
