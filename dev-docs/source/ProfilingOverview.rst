Profiling can mean a few different things, so here are the current ways!

Profiling with Valgrind
-----------------------

This option is Linux only. See :doc:`ProfilingWithValgrind` for details.

Profiling with cProfile
-----------------------

Mantid supports profiling of its underlying code using the `cProfile <https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html>`_ module from python.

Launch Mantid Workbench from the command line using the script in the installation folder, adding the ``--profile`` modifier with a path to the output file.

E.g: ``path/to/install/bin/workbench --profile path/to/outputFile.prof``

This profile can then either be sent to the developers upon request or be analysed using the python module `snakeviz <https://pypi.org/project/snakeviz/>`_.


Profiling with Yappi
--------------------

cProfile can only profile the current thread, this makes it useful for diagnosing PyQt performance issues (such as random hangs when a user does something), but poor for diagnosing workflow algorithm issues.

`Yappi (Yet Another Python Profiler) <https://pypi.org/project/yappi/>`_ is multithreading aware. cProfile which will show everything up to the exec, or run call. Yappi will profile the thread and show any slow points within the separate thread.

*Note: This will not with QThreads and may crash or be unable to profile inside. It is recommended you migrate workers by inheriting from IQtAsync, see async_qt_adaptor.py for details.  Using native threading enables tooling, makes testing simple and produces readable stack traces.*

To use Yappi instead of cProfile simple append `--yappi` to the list of arguments after profile, e.g.:

.. code:: shell

   # If you do not have yappi installed
   python3 -m pip install yappi --user
   # Run with Yappi profiler
   ./MantidWorkbench --profile name_of_profile.out --yappi

KCachegrind can be used to view profiling data, see :doc:`ProfilingWithValgrind` for more details on usage.


Profiling an algorithm
----------------------

On Linux, the build can be configured to generate algorithm profiling information. See :doc:`AlgorithmProfiler <AlgorithmProfiler>` for details.


Other Profiling Tools

`Callgrind/KCachegrind <http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/show.cgi/KcacheGrindIndex>`__

-  KCachegrind visualizes callgrind output.
-  See :ref:`Profiling With Valgrind <ProfilingWithValgrind>` for help on
   running callgrind

`gperftools <https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools>`__

-  Takes snapshot of run and prints percentage of calls in functions
