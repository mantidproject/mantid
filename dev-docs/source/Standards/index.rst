Coding Standards
----------------

Coding standards are vital for creating a maintainable and extensible
system. However in order for them to be effective they have to be
accepted and supported by the entire development team.

Code produced by code generators is not covered directly by this
procedure. Programmers must apply the underlying principles of this
procedure in a sensible manner to code generated automatically.
