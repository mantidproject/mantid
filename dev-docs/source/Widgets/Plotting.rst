Plotting *(Elemental Analysis)*
===============================

Plotting without errors:

Plotting with errors:

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The plotting submodule of *Elemental Analysis* (``/scripts/Muon/ElementalAnalysis/Plotting``) is a PyQt4/5 compatible interactive interface of up to four subplots, each with separate, changeable axes.

The x and y limits of each plot (including all plots simultaneously) can be changed using the AxisChanger widgets, and errors can be plotted by using the ``Errors`` checkbox.
AxisChanger input boxes are automatically updated when the selected plot changes.

The design is such that the user has the ability to handle all matplotlib objects,
whilst the plotting and axis changing is handled internally.
For this reason, only functions that are *absolutely necessary* should be exposed, as this maintains simplicity for the user of the wrapper.

Functionality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The four subplot arrangements are:

- One subplot, centered
- Two subplots, side-by-side
- Three subplots, stacked on top of each other
- Four subplots, in a two-by-two grid

*This layout can be changed by modifying ``plotting_utils.py``.*

Usage
^^^^^
::

    (importing plotting as plotting)
    subplot_name = "subplot name"
    subplot = plotting.add_subplot(subplot_name) # creates subplot (& updates the grid)
    # this is a standard matplotlib subplot object, so has all the usual methods
    # alternatively
    plotting.add_subplot(subplot_name)
    #later on...
    subplot = plotting.get_subplot(subplot_name)
    plotting.plot(subplot_name, mtd["test workspace"]) # plots the workspace "test workspace" to subplot
    plotting.remove_subplot(subplot_name) # removes the subplot (& updates the grid)

    (... add then delete lines, or text/annotations etc. ...)
    # lines can be added as normal in matplotlib
    # for example:
    line = subplot.axvline(x_axis, y_min, y_max, **kwargs)
    #or:
    line = plotting.get_subplot(subplot_name).axvline(x_axis, y_min, y_max, **kwargs)
    plotting.update_canvas() # will update the canvas (generally only required for deleting things)

File and Code Layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Plotting_ files are arranged in the following format:
::

    Plotting:
        AxisChanger/
            axis_changer_presenter.py
            axis_changer_view.py
        plotting_presenter.py
        plotting_view.py
        plotting_utils.py

Both the Plotting and AxisChanger modules are in MVP (Model, View, Presenter) format, as this benefits maintainability.

Plotting Presenter
""""""""""""""""""
Exposes required functions from ``plotting_view.py``.

::

    def get_subplot(self, name):
        """
        Returns the subplot with the given name.

        :param name: the name of the subplot
        :returns: a matplotlib subplot object
        :raises KeyError: if the subplot name doesn't exist
        """
        return self.view.get_subplot(name)
*Functions should only be exposed if they are necessary for use with the plotting interface.*

Plotting View
"""""""""""""
Handles all the ``matplotlib`` and ``Qt``. Currently, ``plotting_view.py`` is arguably too large (due to the requirement of isolating ``matplotlib`` and ``Qt``), so this could be split up in a future version.

Plotting Utils
""""""""""""""
Handles the gridspec layouts: further gridspecs can be defined in ``plotting_utils.py``, but ``self.gridspecs`` must be updated in ``plotting_view.py``

TODO
^^^^
- Move plotting to a more central, accessible location in the mantid codebase
- Options for changing line colours, fonts etc.
- Moveable lines with the related events (i.e. can check whether a line is moved within tolerance of a given x value)
- Addition of more subplots
- Exporting subplots as PNGs etc.
- Removal of individual plots from a subplot (the way plotted lines are stored would have to be changed)

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
- TBC after testing

Related Bugs/Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- `Matplotlib Issue #4786`_: a workaround is used in ``plotting_view.py`` (commented)
- ``plot.set_subplotspec(...)`` is required where ``plot.set_position(...)`` is used with ``tight_layout()``
- ``matplotlib.pyplot`` `should not`_ be imported when using ``FigureCanvasQTAgg``

AxisChanger
^^^^^^^^^^^
``AxisChanger`` is a small widget comprising of two ``QLineEdit``s in a neat format,
with events exposed for x/y limit changing. This functionality is inherently separate
to that of the plotting, so the AxisChanger module is separate (albeit enclosed within) the plotting.
