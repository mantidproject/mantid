What is calculated in a SANS reduction?
#######################################

This section gives a summary of what is calculated during the ISIS SANS reduction
without going into implementation details. This is done in some sections below.

The starting point is equation 5 in the article by
Richard Heenan et al, *J. Appl. Cryst.* (1997), pages 1140-1147. The coherent
macroscopic cross-section is calculated at ISIS using :


.. math::
  \frac{\partial \Sigma}{\partial \Omega} (Q) = \frac{Scale}{V_{SAM}} \frac{\sum_{R,\lambda \subset Q}C(R,\lambda)}{\sum_{R,\lambda \subset Q}M(\lambda)T(\lambda)D(\lambda)F(R)\Omega (R) Cor(R,\lambda)}

This equation is aiming to do the best job at returning from the measured SANS
data the quantity of interest, the cross-section, :math:`\frac{\partial \Sigma}{\partial \Omega}`,
which is an absolute scattering probability, in units of :math:`cm_{-1}`. The :math:`Scale`
factor in the equation above fine tunes the cross-section to give the correct
value (usually based on a fit to scattering from a standard polymer sample).
The value of :math:`Scale`  varies with the instrument set up, and with how the
units and normalisation for the other terms are chosen. :math:`C(R,\lambda)`
are the observed counts at radius vector :math:`R` from the diffractometer axis
and wavelength :math:`\lambda`. :math:`V_{SAM}` is the volume of the sample.
:math:`M(\lambda)` is an incident monitor spectrum. :math:`D(\lambda)` contains
the relative efficiency of the main detector compared to the incident monitor.
:math:`D(\lambda)` is initially determined experimentally, but later subjected
to empirical adjustments. In reality the detector efficiencies implied in
:math:`D(\lambda)` are also pixel dependent. This variation is in part
accounted for by :math:`F(R)`, which is called the flat cell or flood source
calibration file. :math:`F(R)` is also determined experimentally, and aims to
contain information about the relative efficiency of individual detector pixels.
It is normalised to values close to 1 in order not to change the overall scaling
of the equation. The experimental flood source data are divided by detector pixel
solid angles at their measurement set up to give :math:`F(R)`.
Detector pixel solid angles are calculated for the instrument geometry at the
time of the SANS experiment. :math:`Cor(R,\lambda)` optionally takes into account
any corrections that cannot be described as only pixel dependent or only
wavelength dependent. One such example is for the angle dependence of
transmissions, :ref:`SANSWideAngleCorrection <algm-SANSWideAngleCorrection>`. :math:`T(\lambda)`
is the transmission, which measures the ratio of neutron counts after the sample,
divided by the neutron counts before the sample. :math:`T(\lambda)` is calculated
from a “transmission run” and a “direct run”. There are at least three ways to
measure transmission: using a monitor that drops in after the sample position,
a monitor on the main beam stop or by attenuating the beam, removing the beam stop,
and using the main detector itself. In all cases counts on the “transmission detector”
with a sample in the beam are divided by those for an empty (or “direct”) beam.
In order to allow for different exposures or changes in moderator spectrum,
each transmission spectrum is also first normalised to an incident beam monitor spectrum.
The sample transmission and direct beam transmissions must of course be acquired
with the same beam line set up, and ideally around the same time in case of any
electronic or performance drift.

Also, note that a SANS experiment frequently involves measurements of the sample (*Sample*)
material of interest contained inside a can (*Can*) or dissolved in a solvent inside a
cell. Separate SANS and transmission measurements must be made for the can or for
the pure solvent in a cell. For convenience this is always referred to as the
*Can* run. (Though for say a solid sample with no can, the *Can* run may actually
be simply an empty beam run.) The full data reduction is performed separately for
*Sample* and then the *Can*, before subtracting the *Can* cross-section from the *Sample*
plus *Can* cross-section, to obtain the cross-section for the *Sample* alone.
(In practise there can be some excluded volume and other annoying effects where
hydrogenous solvents are involved.)

Introduction and Motivation
---------------------------

The ISIS SANS v2 reduction back-end is a more modern and updated version of the
original ISIS SANS reduction back-end which has been in use for almost 10 years.

Users who sets up a SANS reduction work-flow have control over a vast number of
settings (>50) in addition to settings which are extracted from the provided
workspaces and instrument specific settings. The total number of settings which
define a SANS data reduction can be close to 100.

The previous implementation of the SANS data reduction stored the settings
non-centrally and allowed the overall state to be mutable.
This made it extremely hard to reason about the overall state of a data
reduction and lead to unnecessary data reloads, degrading the overall
performance. Also, the direct coupling of the state to the algorithms does not allow
for extending them to other facilities.

The new implementation of the SANS data reduction aims to avoid these pitfalls
and focusses on robustness, maintainability and performance. The main way to
achieve this is to use a simple state object which stores the reduction-relevant
information centrally.

Overview
--------

The reduction back-end consists of three components:

- the *SANSState* approach to centrally store the state of the reduction
- a set of work-flow algorithms which perform the individual reduction steps
- algorithms which orchestrate the work-flow algorithms.


*SANSState*
###########

Motivation
----------

As mentioned above, the amount of parameters that can be set by the user makes
the SANS reduction one of the more complex ones in the Mantid ecosystem. Previous
implementations stored the settings non-centrally which led to many difficult-to-find
bugs and a lot of uncertainty about the current settings of the reduction as they
were changed during the reduction.

This has been the main bottleneck of the previous reduction framework. To overcome
this, the new implementation of the SANS data reduction uses a simple state object
which stores the reduction-relevant information centrally.
This *SANSState* approach is the corner stone of the new design.

The *SANSState* is:

- self-validating
- immutable (currently this is not enforced on the object itself, but should be added in the future.
             The reduction code is written however such that it does not make sense to mutate the state
             while a reduction is running.)
- typed
- serializable
- easy to reason about
- modular (sub-states for units of work)

This approach allows us to identify issues with the settings before a lengthy
data reduction has been started.


Components
----------

This section describes the essential components of the state mechanism.
These include the states themselves, the parameters in a state and
the state construction.


*state_base.py*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *JsonSerializable* metaclass contains the essential ingredients for
serializing a state object. Additionally it provides a decorator for any
Enum types which need to be JSON serializable.

Any classes which use the metaclass must place any attributes they intend
to be serialized into JSON string in the instance. I.e. class level variables
are not recommended since they may not end up in the instances internal
dictionary.

The *Serializer* is responsible for serialization using the JSON library and
provides static methods to (de)serialize to a string or file.


Individual states
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The overall state object is made of sub-state objects which carry all required
information for a single reduction step or other unit of work.
This ensures that all the sub-states are independent of each other carry all
required information. Note that this also means that some data is stored
redundantly, for example the binning for the wavelength conversion is stored
in the state object used for monitor normalization and in the state object
for the transmission calculation.

In the following sections we list the different parameters on the currently
implemented states.


*state.py*
**********

The *State* class is the overarching state which contains sub-states where each
sub-state has a different responsibility (see below).

*data.py*
*********

This is the most important state. Since the reduction framework has a data-driven
approach it is not possible to build up most of the reduction without knowing what
the actual data for the reduction will be.

Note that while some parameters are optional they might become mandatory if other
optional parameters have been specified. Also note that some of the parameters
on the state are auto-generated by the builder classes.


*move.py*
*********

The move state defines how instruments are moved. This is highly individual to
the different instruments. Therefore there is most likely going to be one state
per instrument, sometimes even more when there should be different behaviour for
different run numbers.

The fundamental class is *StateMove* which has the following parameters:

=============================== ======= ========================== ========= =============== =============

If nothing is specified, then the detector positions and movements are assumed to be 0.
Note that each instrument contains additional parameters on their individual state classes. When adding
a new instrument, this will be most likely one of the main areas to add new code.

*adjustment.py*
***************

Adjustment workspaces are generated to be consumed in the momentum transfer conversion step.
There are three types of adjustments

- Pure wavelength adjustments, i.e. adjustments which only affect the bins.
- Pure pixel adjustments, i.e. adjustments which only affect the spectra
- Pixel-and-wavelength adjustments, i.e. adjustments which affect both the bins and spectra

The *StateAdjustment* class is a composite state which is made of information
relating to the different types of adjustments

The parameters are:

Note that the transmission information can be either collected via a monitor or
via a region on the detector. In the former case *transmission_monitor* is the
relevant parameter whereas in the latter case it is *transmission_radius_on_detector*,
*transmission_roi_files* and *transmission_mask_files*. Also note that we have
instrument specific versions of these state classes, mainly to accommodate for
the different wavelength ranges (and potentially default prompt peak settings.)

The above mentioned *StateTransmissionFit* class contains fit information for
the transmission calculation. Note that each data type, can contain its separate
fit information. The set of parameters describing this fit are:

Note that the polynomial order is set to 0 by default. This forces the user to
actively set a polynomial order if polynomial fitting has been selected.

Note that if *use_q_resolution* is enabled, then either the aperture information
for the circular or the rectangular case needs to be specified.


*compatibility.py*
******************

The *StateCompatibility* class is not directly part of the reduction, but it will
convert event-mode workspaces early on to histogram-mode workspaces in order to
emulate the old reduction work-flow. This allows for a direct comparison between
results of the new and old reduction framework. The name *compatibility* has
been chosen in order to indicate that we are testing for compatibility with the
results of the old reduction framework.

State Generation
-----------------

User input can come in the form of user files, the Python interface or the GUI. In
some of these cases the order in which the parameters are set is not always in the
same order and sometimes a parameter can be set multiple times (e.g. via the user file).
These settings are captured in an input dictionary and then processed
by builder classes which are coordinated by a state director. These components are
described below.

User input dictionary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned above, we cannot make any assumptions about the order or multiplicity of the
user commands. We use a simple Python dictionary to store the specified settings.
In fact, the dictionary maps from enum-like classes, defined in *settings_tags.py* to
a list of settings. The settings can be simple values, lists, dictionaries or *named_tuples* defined
in *settings_tags.py*.

Note that the naming of a large chunk of the the enum-like classes in *settings_tags.py*
was driven by the corresponding name in the user file definition. We can consider
changing the naming in the future. Also note that some settings only allow one value,
which means that the director which uses these settings will use the last value in the list.

The user input dictionary is normally populated by the settings specified in the user file and
parsed by *UserFileParser* in *user_file_parser.py*. In addition the dictionary can
be modified by using the *ISISCommandInterface* or the SANS GUI. Changes to the original
settings will override settings specified in the user file.


An example dictionary entry for the fit parameters during the transmission
calculation for a *Can* data set could be:

.. code-block:: python

  {FitId.general: fit_general(start=1.0,
                              stop=3.0,
                              fit_type=FitType.Polynomial,
                              data_type=DataType.Can,
                              polynomial_order=2)

This entry is added to the general user input dictionary. Note that for some of the
input values, enums from *enums.py* are used, e.g. *FitType.Polynomial*. This approach is
used throughout the reduction-back-end.


Builders
^^^^^^^^^

The state object is constructed via the builder pattern. Each state has its own builder
which will construct the correct state or sub-state based on the input parameter. Note that
the selection of the state in these builders is often driven by the information
contained in an object of type *StateData*. The data determines which algorithm strategy and
hence which sub-state to choose. This data-driven approach was chosen deliberately, since
the data automatically defines the values of a large set of reduction parameters, e.g. the
instrument name or the path to the IDF file. Note that the coordination of the
builders for the different states is performed by a state director.

Let's have a look at an example of a typical builder. We examine the builder for scaling.
The relevant builder is chosen via the factory method *def get_scale_builder(data_info)*
where *data_info* is an object of type *StateData*. The resulting *StateScaleBuilder* allows
for setting the parameters on the state object which is currently being built. Via the
*automatic_setters* decorator it provides setter methods which forward to the state which is currently built.
The name of the the setters is *set_PARAMTERNAME* for a given parameter name on the state.
The advantage of the decorator is that we can exclude access to parameters of the state which
are automatically set by the builder.

.. code-block:: python

  class StateScaleBuilder(object):
      @automatic_setters(StateScale, exclusions=[])
      def __init__(self, data_info):
        ...

In the *exclusions* input we can specify parameters which should not receive a setter.
Note the the first input of the decorator is the state class which is being constructed by
the builder.


Selection of the builders
**************************

As stated above the builders are made available via factory methods. Currently, most
of the factory methods just check if we are dealing with an ISIS instrument and provide
the appropriate builder. Unknown instruments will raise an *NotImplementedError*. When
extending the framework to other instruments this is something that needs to be explicitly
enabled for all states. This was done deliberately in order to ensure that the reduction state
matches the new instrument.

Directors
^^^^^^^^^

As explained above each state has its own builder which in turn is selected via a factory method.
To coordinate the builders and feed them the information that has been made available for example
via the user file, the GUI or the CLI, we need an entity which coordinates the builders and the access
to the relevant information. This task is managed by state directors.

*state_director.py*
*******************

The main director which handles the coordination of the builders and the only one which
is actually aware of them is *StateDirectorISIS*. The director manages the user input
dictionary which was discussed earlier. It is also possible to provide a user file as input or
a user input dictionary.

This director is used by other directors which are responsible for creating the user input
dictionary for the CLI and GUI case. These directors don't know anything about the builders or
the state, but are only responsible for providing the user input. An exception to this
is the *StateData* object, since it is used indirectly to choose the correct builders
for the other sub-states. Hence the role of the outer level directors is to provide the
*StateDirectorISIS* object with general user input information and information about the data.


User file input
***************

The user file is an import aspect of setting up a reduction for a SANS work-flow. Conventionally,
most of the settings are defined in the user file and only few settings are adjusted/provided
via the CLI or the GUI.

The information in the user file is converted to the user input dictionary.
This is currently achieved with a *UserFileParser* object. Future user files will
potentially make use of a custom *yaml*-style format. This will require a new
parser which will easily replace the current parser since only a single
interface method (*parse_line* which takes a single line to parse)
needs to be provided.

For an overview of the user file commands, please see the
`user file documentation <https://www.mantidproject.org/SANS_User_File_Commands>`_ .

Director for *ISISCommandInterface* (CLI)
*****************************************

The *ISISCommandInterface* is used by some of the power users among the instrument scientists. It is
an efficient way to customize reductions which require small tweaks between different reductions.
Please consult the `scripting documentation <https://www.mantidproject.org/Scripting_SANS_Reductions>`_
for the *ISISCommandInterface* for more information.

The principal component which sets up the state behind the scene is *CommandInterfaceStateDirector*. It has to deal
with the complication that we are only able to set up the reduction state after all information has been provided, hence
it collects all the inputs and stores this information between CLI calls. Once processing has been requested, it
pre-processes some of this input and passes the information via a user input dictionary to the standard state director.


Usage via GUI
**************

The GUI stores the user input dictionary in the *StateGuiModel* class
in *state_gui_model.py* which is then consumed by the *GuiStateDirector* in
*gui_state_directory.py*. The state model contains most of the information required
for the state generation. Some further settings, especially regarding the data
which is to be reduced, is stored in the *TableModel* in *table_model.py*.


Other useful information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*enum.py*
*********

This module contains many enum-like classes. Since we cannot make use of the *enum*
features of Python 3 and don't want to work with string comparisons, we roll out
our own enums. Two things are noteworthy here:

- Using the *string_convertible* decorator allows the enum classes to be
  string-convertible which is useful when they are being used in state objects
  which themselves need to be serializable.
- The *serializable_enum* decorator allows to correctly register the enum values.
  Note that this decorator alters the *__module__* of the nested classes.

Work-flow algorithms for individual reduction steps
###################################################

Here we intend to discuss the functionality of the individual work-flow algorithms
which make up the SANS reduction. The algorithms can be found in *Framework/PythonInterface/plugins/WorkflowAlgorithms/SANS*.
Some of the implementation is placed into *scripts/SANS/sans/algorithm_detail* in order
avoid large scripts sizes.

The dedicated work-flow algorithms for the SANS reduction are:

- *Calculate SANS Transmission*
- *Create SANS Wavelength Pixel Adjustment*
- :ref:`CropToComponent <algm-CropToComponent>`
- :ref:`Divide <algm-Divide>` (by Sample Volume)
- :ref:`Multiply <algm-Multiply>` (by Absolute Scale)
- :ref:`MoveInstrumentComponent <algm-MoveInstrumentComponent>`
- *Normalize To SANS Monitor*
- :ref:`Q1D <algm-Q1D>` or :ref:`Qxy <algm-Qxy>`
- :ref:`RotateInstrumentComponent <algm-RotateInstrumentComponent>`
- :ref:`SANSConvertToWavelengthAndRebin <algm-SANSConvertToWavelengthAndRebin>`
- :ref:`SANSLoad <algm-SANSLoad>`
- *SANSSave*
- *Slice SANS Event*
- *Workspace Masking*

Note that algorithms prefixed with SANS take a *SANSState* object as
an input.

The individual algorithms are superficially discussed below.

There are two further algorithms which coordinate these algorithms, they are *SANSReductionCore* and
*SANSSingleReduction* which are discussed further down.


*Calculate SANS Transmission*
------------------------------
The following steps are performed:

1. Select the incident monitor. If this is not explicitly set then the default value is taken.
2. Select the transmission detector ids. The detector ids are chosen via the following preference:

   a. If available, get detector ids from region-of-interest selection on detector
   b. Else if available get detector ids from transmission monitor setting
   c. Else get default transmission monitor

3. Get the corrected transmission workspace. The sub-steps are:

   a. Load the transmission workspace
   b. Extract the transmission detector ids with :ref:`ExtractSpectra <algm-ExtractSpectra>`
   c. Perform prompt peak correction
   d. Perform flat background correction to monitors (if applicable) using :ref:`CalculateFlatBackground <algm-CalculateFlatBackground>`
   e. Perform flat background correction to other detectors (if applicable) using :ref:`CalculateFlatBackground <algm-CalculateFlatBackground>`
   f. Convert to wavelength and rebin using :ref:`SANSConvertToWavelengthAndRebin <algm-SANSConvertToWavelengthAndRebin>`

4. Get the corrected direct workspace. The sub-steps are:

   a. Load the direct workspace
   b. Extract the transmission detector ids with :ref:`ExtractSpectra <algm-ExtractSpectra>`
   c. Perform prompt peak correction (if applicable) using :ref:`RemoveBins <algm-RemoveBins>`
   d. Perform flat background correction to monitors (if applicable) using :ref:`CalculateFlatBackground <algm-CalculateFlatBackground>`
   e. Perform flat background correction to other detectors (if applicable) using :ref:`CalculateFlatBackground <algm-CalculateFlatBackground>`
   f. Convert to wavelength and rebin using :ref:`SANSConvertToWavelengthAndRebin <algm-SANSConvertToWavelengthAndRebin>`

5. Perform fitting for the transmission calculation. The sub-steps are:

   a. Use incident monitor, wavelength settings, transmission detector ids, fit
      settings as well as the corrected transmission (step 3) and direct (step4)
      workspaces to initialize :ref:`CalculateTransmission <algm-CalculateTransmission>`
   b. Execute :ref:`CalculateTransmission <algm-CalculateTransmission>`
   c. Get the fitted and unfitted output workspaces

6. Set the fitted and unfitted workspaces on the output of the algorithm.


Conversion to Q
----------------
If a 1D reduction has been selected then the algorithm will perform the follow sub-steps:

1. Calculate the momentum transfer resolution workspace using :ref:`TOFSANSResolutionByPixel <algm-TOFSANSResolutionByPixel>` (if applicable)
2. Set data workspace, adjustment workspaces, momentum transfer resolution workspace
   (if applicable), radius and wavelength cut-offs, momentum transfer limits
   and the gravity correction on :ref:`Q1D <algm-Q1D>`
3. Execute :ref:`Q1D <algm-Q1D>`
4. Get reduced workspace, the sum-of-counts workspace and the sum-of-norm workspaces
   and set on the output of the algorithm

If a 2D reduction has been selected then the algorithm will perform the following sub-steps:

1. Set data workspace, adjustment workspaces, momentum transfer resolution workspace
   (if applicable), radius and wavelength cut-offs, momentum transfer limits
   and the gravity correction on :ref:`Qxy <algm-Qxy>`
2. Execute :ref:`Qxy <algm-Qxy>`
3. Get reduced workspace, the sum-of-counts workspace and the sum-of-norm workspaces
   and set on the output of the algorithm


*SANSConvertToWavelengthAndRebin*
-----------------------------------

The :ref:`SANSConvertToWavelengthAndRebin <algm-SANSConvertToWavelengthAndRebin>`
algorithm is one of the few which does not take a *SANSState* object as an input.

The algorithm performs the following steps:

1. Unit conversion from time-of-flight units to wavelength units using :ref:`ConvertUnits <algm-ConvertUnits>`
2. Performs a rebin operation using either :ref:`Rebin <algm-Rebin>` or :ref:`InterpolatingRebin <algm-InterpolatingRebin>`


*Create SANS Wavelength and Pixel Adjustment*
---------------------------------------------

This step combines the output of the *Calculate SANS Transmission* step,
the output of the *Normalize To SANS Monitor*,
and flood and direct files to produce the correction workspaces which
are required for converting to Q.

The sub-steps of the algorithm are:

1. Create the wavelength-adjustment workspace. The sub-steps are:

   a. Get the calculate-transmission workspace from the input
   b. Get the normalization-to-monitor workspace from the input
   c. Load the wavelength-adjustment file using :ref:`LoadRKH <algm-LoadRKH>`
   d. Provide all of the above workspaces with the same binning using :ref:`Rebin <algm-Rebin>`
      and multiply them using :ref:`Multiply <algm-Multiply>`

2. Create the pixel-adjustment workspace. The sub-states are:

   a. Load the pixel-adjustment file using :ref:`LoadRKH <algm-LoadRKH>`
   b. Crop the pixel-adjustment workspace to the desired detector
      using :ref:`CropToComponent <algm-CropToComponent>`

3. Set the pixel-adjustment and wavelength-adjustment workspaces on the output of the algorithm

*SANSLoad*
------------

The :ref:`SANSLoad <algm-SANSLoad>` algorithm is responsible for loading data and applying the calibration
where required. This algorithm loads SANS data sets. The loading can handle nexus
and raw files which can be plain or multi-period data. In addition the algorithm
has to be able to handle added files. The SANS data sets which can be loaded
with this algorithm are:

* sample scatter data which is the actual data under investigation. The algorithm
  loads the corresponding monitor workspace separately
* sample transmission data
* sample direct data
* can scatter data. The algorithm also loads the corresponding monitor workspace separately
* can transmission data
* can direct data

In addition a calibration file which is applied after the data has been loaded
can be specified. The calibration performs micro-adjustments to the detectors.

The algorithm sub-steps are:

1. Based on the input data a loading strategy is selected.
2. For each workspace in the *StateData* state object we load the data (with the loading strategy from step 1). The sub-states are:

   a. If optimizations are enabled check if the desired workspace already exists
      on the ADS. If so, fetch it and return it. We are done with loading this data set.
   b. Else get the correct loader strategy (e.g. for event-mode files) and load
      the data. This will load either all periods or just the specified period
      where applicable. If scatter data is loaded, then the monitor data is loaded
      into a separate workspace with the suffix "_monitors".

3. Apply calibration if required. Note that the algorithm loads the calibration
   workspace from the ADS if it exists there when optimizations are enabled. Else
   it loads it from file and places it on the ADS.
4. Set the loaded workspaces on the output of the algorithm.
5. For LOQ apply transmission corrections if applicable. This will apply a different
   instrument definition for transmission runs.

*Workspace Masking*
---------------------
There are several types of masking which are currently supported:

- Time/Bin masking.
- Radius masking.
- Mask files.
- Spectrum masking which includes individual spectra, spectra ranges, spectra
  blocks and spectra cross blocks. These masks are partially specified on a detector level (see below).
- Angle masking.
- Beam stop masking.

Note that only those of the following steps are executed where the user has specified
a particular masking instruction. The algorithm sub-steps are:

1. Select the correct masking strategy (currently only ISIS)
2. Apply time bin masking. The sub-steps are:

   a. Apply general time bin masks using :ref:`MaskBins <algm-MaskBins>`
   b. Apply detector specific time bin masks using :ref:`MaskBins <algm-MaskBins>`

3. Apply cylinder masking. This generates a hollow cylinder which masks the
   beam stop (defined by an inner radius) and anything outside of an area of
   interest (defined by an outer radius). The sub-steps are:

   a. Set up the inner and the outer radius of the cylinder mask.
   b. Mask everything outside of the hollow cylinder using :ref:`MaskDetectorsInShape <algm-MaskDetectorsInShape>`

4. Apply a list of mask files. For each mask file the sub-steps are:

   a. Load the mask file into a workspace using :ref:`LoadMask <algm-LoadMask>`
   b. Apply the mask workspace to the scatter workspace using :ref:`MaskDetectors <algm-MaskDetectors>`

5. Apply spectrum masks. The sub-steps are:

   a. Get the spectra masks for single spectra, spectrum ranges,
      single horizontal spectrum strips, single vertical spectrum strips,
      horizontal spectrum range (several strips next to each other),
      vertical spectrum range (several strips next to each other),
      block masks and block cross masks
   b. Mask the selected spectra using :ref:`MaskDetectors <algm-MaskDetectors>`

6. Apply angle masking. This is used for pizza-slice masking and uses
   :ref:`MaskDetectorsInShape <algm-MaskDetectorsInShape>`

7. Apply beam stop masking. The beam stop consists of a disc where the beam is located
   and a connection arm (rod) which holds the disc. The disc has at this point
   already been masked by a cylinder mask. This step masks the connection arm using
   :ref:`MaskDetectorsInShape <algm-MaskDetectorsInShape>`


*MoveInstrumentComponent* and *RotateInstrumentComponent*
---------------------------------------------------------

The :ref:`MoveInstrumentComponent <algm-MoveInstrumentComponent>`
algorithm and :ref:`RotateInstrumentComponent <algm-RotateInstrumentComponent>`
are used in one of three ways, depending on how the state
of the script. It can be used to move an individual component, reset positions,
or specify the beam centre.
Note that if the beam centre is also specified in the state object, then the
manual selection takes precedence.


*Normalize To SANS Monitor*
---------------------------

This step provides a monitor normalization workspace for subsequent
wavelength correction in :ref:`algm-Q1D` or :ref:`algm-Qxy`.
The user can provide a *ScaleFactor* which is
normally obtained during event slicing.

The sub-steps of this step are:

1. Get the incident monitor spectrum number and the scale factor
2. Extract the monitor spectrum using :ref:`ExtractSingleSpectrum <algm-ExtractSingleSpectrum>` into a monitor workspace
3. Apply the scale factor to the monitor workspace using :ref:`Scale <algm-Scale>`
4. Perform a prompt peak correction (if applicable) using :ref:`RemoveBins <algm-RemoveBins>`
5. Perform a flat background correction (if applicable) using :ref:`CalculateFlatBackground <algm-CalculateFlatBackground>`
6. Convert to wavelength units and rebin using
   :ref:`SANSConvertToWavelengthAndRebin <algm-SANSConvertToWavelengthAndRebin>`


*SANSSave*
------------

The :ref:`SANSSave <algm-SANSSave>`  algorithm performs two steps:

1. Create a cloned workspace where the zero-error values are inflated (if this is requested)
2. Save the workspace into each specified file format.

Zero-error inflation is useful for data points where the error is 0. When performing
any form of regression of this the zero-valued error will fix the model at this point.
If we inflate the error at this point then it does not contribute to the regression.


*Slice SANS Event*
------------------

This step creates a sliced workspace from an event-based
SANS input workspace according to the settings in the state object. The algorithm
will extract a slice based on a start and end time which are set in the state
object. In addition, the data type, i.e. if the slice is to be taken from a sample
or a can workspace, can be specified. Note that the monitor workspace is not
being sliced but scaled by the ratio of the proton charge of the sliced
workspace to the proton charnge of the full workspace.

The sub-states of this algorithm are:

1. Get the start time and the end time of the time slice
2. If the data set is from a *Can* measurement, then don't perform a slice
3. Slice the scatter workspace using the start and end time and :ref:`FilterByTime <algm-FilterByTime>`
4. Get the partial charge for the sliced data and calculate the slice factor which is *(partial charge) / (total charge)*
5. Multiply the monitor workspace with the scale factor
6. Set the sliced scatter data, the scaled monitor data and the slice factor on the output of this algorithm


Work-flow algorithm orchestration
#################################

The orchestration of the work-flow algorithms is mainly handled by the *SANSReductionCore*
class in *sans_reduction_core.py*. It defines the sequence of work-flow algorithms and how data is
passed between them. However, executing the algorithm *SANSReductionCore* does
not run a full reduction, but rather only reduces either the sample or the can data.

For this the *SANSSingleReduction* algorithm was developed.
It runs *SANSReductionCore* with the appropriate
data (sample or can) and performs the required post processing, e.g. stitching.
This algorithm will produce a fully reduced output. However it will not produce it in the desired form,
e.g. correct name of the output workspaces, grouping of multi-period reduced data etc. This is achieved with
an instance of *SANSBatchReduction* (not a work-flow algorithm!) in module *sans_batch.py*. This
is the entry point for any reduction.


*SANSBatchReduction*
----------------------

This class is the entry point for any reduction and is not an algorithm but rather
a script. It takes three important inputs:

- A list of SANS state objects. Each state object defines a reduction. In fact if the state object contains
  period data with :math:`N` periods and :math:`M` time slices it will in fact define :math:`N \times M` reductions.
- A *use_optimizations* boolean flag. If true, the data loading mechanism will check the ADS first if
  the required data is available from there and only load the data if it is not present. It will place newly
  loaded data into the ADS. The ADS is also checked for can reductions.
- An *output_mode* enum, which can be:

  - *PublishToADS* means that the reduced data is added to the ADS
  - *SaveToFile* means that the reduced data is saved only to file
  - *Both* means that the reduced data is added to the ADS and saved to file


*SANSBatchReduction* reduces the list of states sequentially. The for-loop in
the *execute* method lends itself to parallelization via *MPI*, hence this could be
a potential future optimization if this should be required. The sub-steps to
handle each state object are:

1. Load the data which is relevant for the particular reduction (make use of optimizations if applicable)
2. If the state object contains multi-period data with :math:`N` periods and/or :math:`M` time slices
   then generate :math:`N \times M` state objects
3. For each state object run the *SANSSingleReduction* algorithm
4. Group the output workspaces if required, e.g. for reduced multi-period data
5. Provide workspaces to the selected output channel, i.e. ADS, files or both.

Note that *SANSBatchReduction* also sets the name of the reduced data.

The users can interact with the new SANS reduction back-end either via the GUI or
the Python interface. Both of these methods utilize the *SANSBatchReduction*
to perform the reduction.


*SANSSingleReduction*
-----------------------

The *SANSSingleReduction* algorithm defines a single complete reduction of
a data set, i.e. it will run the reduction for the *Sample* and *Can* and perform
the subtraction of these results if the reduction has been set up
to do this. In particular this algorithm stitches the reduced workspaces of the
different detectors using :ref:`SANSStitch <algm-SANSStitch>`,
again only if the reduction has been set up to do this.


*SANSReductionCore*
---------------------

This work-flow algorithm actually defines the order of the reduction steps and is the
inner core of the orchestration mechanism. The inputs to this algorithm are

- A SANS state object
- Several input workspaces
- A detector type selection, i.e. *LAB* or *HAB*
- A data type selection, i.e. *Sample* or *Can*

The sub-steps of this algorithm are:

1. Get the cropped input *ScatterWorkspace*. The cropping is defined by the selected detector type.
   The underlying algorithm is :ref:`CropToComponent <algm-CropToComponent>`.
2. Create an event slice of the input workspace.
   Note that event slicing is only applied to event-mode workspaces and only when it has been
   specified by the user. During this step the scatter workspace is sliced and the associated
   monitor workspace is scaled. The scaling factor is the ratio of the charge of the sliced data set
   and the charge of the entire data set.
3. If we are dealing with an even-mode workspace and the compatibility mode has been chosen then
   either a custom binning or the monitor binning is applied using :ref:`Rebin <algm-Rebin>` or
   :ref:`RebinToWorkspace <algm-RebinToWorkspace>`, respectively.
4. Both the data and the monitor workspace perform an initial move operation.
   The first step sets the instrument positions back to the IDF,
   in case the algorithm had been loaded and moved already previously.
   The second time the move algorithm is operated in *InitialMove* mode to apply
   and offset.
5. The data workspace is masked using various modes. Note that
   using :ref:`MoveInstrumentComponent <algm-MoveInstrumentComponent>`.
   The algorithm is applied twice. The first time using the *SetToZero* mode
   to reset the components to known positions from the IDF. The second
   time the components are moved and rotated to the requested positions.
   Note that all steps up until now were performed in the time-of-flight domain.
6. Convert the data from time-of-flight to wavelength.
7. Scale the data set using :ref:`Multiply <algm-Multiply>`. This will multiply the data set
   with the absolute scale and divide :ref:`Divide <algm-Divide>` by the sample volume.
8. This step creates the adjustment workspaces by *Create SANS Adjustment Workspaces*.
   This uses the input *TransmissionWorkspace* and *DirectWorkspace* workspaces. Note that
   the instrument's components are moved and rotated before they are used by the adjustment
   algorithm. The outputs are a wavelength-adjustment workspace, a pixel-adjustment workspace and a wavelength-and-pixel adjustment
   workspace. Note that their creation is optional.
9. Convert the data workspace into histogram-mode using :ref:`RebinToWorkspace <algm-RebinToWorkspace>`.
   This is only relevant for event-mode workspaces where the compatibility mode has not been used. Up until
   now the event-mode workspace could be used as an event workspace, but the momentum transfer conversion (the next step)
   requires a histogram-mode workspace.
10. The final step, the conversion to momentum transfer units, either uses :ref:`Q1D <algm-Q1D>`
    or :ref:`Qxy <algm-Qxy>` depending on the setting of the reduction dimensionality. This step
    uses the data workspace as well as all of the adjustment workspaces which have been provided earlier
    on. The resulting *OutputWorkspace* and the *SumOfCounts* as well as *SumOfNormFactors* counts
    are provided as outputs.
