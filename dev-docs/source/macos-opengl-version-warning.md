```{note}
macOS developers will see the warning from Qt in the terminal:

`An OpenGL surfcace format was requested that is either not version 3.2 or higher or a not Core Profile.`
`Chromium on macOS will fall back to software rendering in this case.`
`Hardware acceleration and features such as WebGL will not be available.`

It can be safely ignored but is present as a reminder of some deprecated
OpenGL functionality being used. It is only visible to developers and
the spelling mistake is real.
```
