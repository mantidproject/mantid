Installing CLion
################

Please note that these instructions only work when using a Ninja generator from a Windows or Linux operating system.

You will also need to have Visual Studio installed on windows.

If you haven't installed CLion yet do that now, CLion can be installed from `here <https://jetbrains.com/clion/download/>`_.

Opening CLion
#############

The first time you build from CLion, you will most likely need to launch it from a terminal or command line to make sure you have access to all the relevant tools.

* On Linux,

  #. Open any terminal
  #. Run ``conda activate mantid-developer``
  #. Then launch CLion from this terminal with ``<CLION_INSTALL>/bin/clion.sh``


* On Windows,

  #. Using your search bar, open the ``x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019`` command prompt
  #. Run ``conda activate mantid-developer``
  #. Then launch CLion with ``<CLION_INSTALL>/bin/clion.bat``

If you get errors about being unable to compile a 'simple test program', then doing the above should fix your issue.

Setup for a CLion Build
#######################

Follow these instructions when the CLion IDE has opened:

To set up your toolchain:

#. Navigate to ``File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Toolchains``
#. Create a new ``System`` toolchain using the ``+`` icon and call it ``Default``
#. Edit the CMake field to point to your conda installed ``cmake``

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 1

      * On Linux: ``/path/to/mambaforge/envs/mantid-developer/bin/cmake``
      * On Windows: ``/path/to/mambaforge/envs/mantid-developer/Library/bin/cmake.exe``

#. Edit the Build Tool field to point to your conda installed ``ninja``

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 1

      * On Linux: ``/path/to/mambaforge/envs/mantid-developer/bin/ninja``
      * On Windows: ``/path/to/mambaforge/envs/mantid-developer/Library/bin/ninja.exe``

#. For the C Compiler and C++ Compiler fields,

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 1

      * On Linux: choose ``Let CMake detect``
      * On Windows: direct them both at the same ``cl.exe`` in your Visual Studio installation, e.g. ``C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio/2019/Community/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.29.30133/bin/Hostx64/x64/cl.exe``

To set up CMake:

#. Navigate to ``File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake``
#. Edit the Build type field by either selecting an option, or typing in a string

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 1

      * On Linux: ``Debug``
      * On Windows: ``DebugWithRelRuntime``

#. Set your Toolchain to be the ``Default`` toolchain that you just created
#. Set your generator to be ``Ninja``
#. Edit your Cmake options to be

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 1

      - On Linux: ``--preset=linux``
      - On Windows: ``--preset=win-ninja``

#. Set the build directory to the ``build`` directory if it is not the default (you'll need to use the full path if its outside the source directory)
#. The configurations drop-down at the top should show all of the build targets. If not, the CMake project is probably not loaded. Go to ``File > Reload CMake Project``. The configurations should be populated

Additional Build Configuration
------------------------------
This (optional) additional configuration allows one to start Clion from the JetBrains Toolbox or
from a terminal without having to activate the conda environment in the terminal.
This is useful when you're working on both Mantid and other projects in CLion simultaneously.

#. Navigate to ``File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake``
#. Under ``environment``, add new environment variable ``CONDA_PREFIX`` with value ``/path/to/mambaforge/envs/mantid-developer``.
#. Navigate to ``File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Python Interpreter > Add Interpreter > Add Local Interpreter > Conda Environment > Use existing environment``, then select ``mantid-developer``.


Building with CLion
###################

- To build all targets, navigate to ``Build > Build All in 'Debug'``. Check that the build command displayed in the Messages window is running the correct cmake executable from your conda installation.
- To build a specific target, select it in the configurations drop-down menu and click the hammer icon next to it.

If this fails, you may need to open CLion from a terminal with your conda environment activated.

It is also useful to have your terminals in CLion to run with this environment:

#. In your ``home`` directory create a file named ``.clionrc`` and open in your favourite text editor, adding these lines:

   .. code-block:: sh

      source ~/.bashrc
      source ~/mambaforge/bin/activate mantid-developer

#. Start CLion using the above steps
#. Navigate to ``File > Settings > Tools > Terminal``
#. To the end of the ``Shell path`` option, add ``--rcfile ~/.clionrc``

Debugging with CLion
####################

To debug workbench, you'll need to edit the ``workbench`` CMake Application configuration.

#. Set the executable to be the ``python`` executable in your conda installation:

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 1

      - On Linux & macOS: ``/path/to/mambaforge/envs/mantid-developer/bin/python``
      - On Windows: ``/path/to/mambaforge/envs/mantid-developer/python.exe``

#. Set the program arguments:

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 1

      - On Linux, macOS and Windows: ``-m workbench --single-process``

#. Set the working directory:

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 1

      - All OS: ``path/to/mambaforge/envs/md/bin/``

#. Set any relevant environment variables:

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 1

      - On macOS: ``PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/full/path/to/build/bin/``

The ``--single-process`` flag is necessary for debugging. See the :ref:`Running Workbench <RunningWorkbench>` documentation for more information.

You should now be able to set breakpoints and start debugging by clicking the bug icon.
