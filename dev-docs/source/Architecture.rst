Summary
-------

Mantid is used for reduction, analysis & visualization of neutron and muon data.
This document describes the architecture of the mantid software in terms
of the `C4 model <C4Model_>`_.

Context
-------

People and other systems interact with the Mantid software package
as decribed by the following context diagram.

   Context diagram for mantid software

Experimental users at neutron/muon facilities use the software
to reduce/analyze their captured data. Mantid uses existing
experimental data access systems to retrieve users' data
for processing either

- interactively via Python scripts or a GUI
- automatically via programmatic access from other systems such as
  automated reduction systems.

Container
---------

*Please note that container here does not mean container in the
deployment (Docker, Singularity) sense of the word, rather the generic
definition of enclosing something.*

The mantid software system is defined as four containers:
two libraries (``framework`` & ``mantidqt``),
one general-purpose, cross-platform, graphical desktop application and
many customized graphical interfaces for specific scientific techniques.
This is illustrated, along with connections between the containers,
in the following diagram.

The ``workbench`` application is written in Python/Qt that provides access
to the business logic for reducing/analyzing data within the ``framework``.
Along with this it provides access to a range of visualization features
defined within the ``mantidqt`` library - A Python/Qt library of custom
widgets that are composed to form the ``workbench`` application.
This library is accessible outside of the workbench application to allow
custom applications to be built from the widgets.

Please note the directional aspect of the connection/dependency arrows.
The connections are strictly one way and those earlier in the dependency chain
cannot contain dependencies on those later, e.g.

- framework *does not* depend on ``mantidqt`` or ``workbench``
- ``mantidqt`` *does not* depend on ``workbench`` but does depend on ``framework``

Components
----------

The following subsections describe each of the containers within the system
in more detail.

Framework
#########

The ``Framework`` refers to the data structures, algorithms
and supporting modules that live within the ``Framework`` directory
of the source tree - commonly referred to as "framework code".
This part of the system is written in C++ and provides the business logic
for reducing and analysing data independent of a graphical environment.
The modules that compose the framework are shown within the following
component diagram.

The framework is separated into a base set of libraries that provide that
core functionality e.g.
workspace objects, instrument objects, algorithm interfaces,
along with a set of plugin libraries that are loaded at runtime to register
new capabilities such as algorithms for data treatment.

A Python package to the C++ libraries, called ``mantid``, is defined in
``Framework/PythonInterface`` and
gives access to the C++-framework code from Python.
The Python package is the primary mode of access to the C++ libraries
for external entities.
Assuming Python paths have been setup correctly, the ``mantid`` package
is to be treated like any other package and can be used in vanilla
Python or any interactive Python environment,
including `Jupyter notebooks <jupyter_>`_.


While the C++ API could be used directly by external parties this is
not a supported method of interaction and API stability of the C++
layer is not guaranteed.

mantidqt

   Container diagram for mantidqt Python package

``mantidqt`` is a Python package defined to house a collection of Qt widgets
that sit on top of ``mantid`` functionality.
They provide a reusable set of widgets that can be used across multiple
interfaces to give a consistent user experience when presenting given
``mantid`` functionality to users. One example of such a widget is the
``mantidqt.widgets.filefinder``, which sits on top of the framework
``FileFinder``, and presents GUI elements to pass through and run the
the framework logic.
Providing a reusable widget gives a consistent user experience across
multiple interfaces/applications when displaying ``mantid`` features to users.

The package contains basic widgets, such as the aforementioned ``filefinder``,
but also more advanced widgets such as
:ref:`slice viewer <sliceviewer>` and
the OpenGL-based :ref:`instrument viewer <InstrumentViewer>`,
which combine many features of the framework together to provide advanced
visualization to users.

The package contains a mixture of C++ and Python code.
It is defined in the ``qt/python/mantidqt`` directory of the source tree.
Widgets written in C++ use the `sip <sip-ref_>`_ system to export the
C++ classes to a Python module.
The raw exported modules are all prefixed with an underscore,
e.g. ``_common``,
and classes are pulled into a pure-python module to decouple
the C++ implementations from users.
This allows for flexibility with the layout of the C++ classes/libraries
without impacting users in the future.
Clients of ``mantidqt`` should never import an underscored module directly.

workbench
#########

   Container diagram for workbench application

``workbench`` is an application written in pure Python in the ``qt/applications/workbench``
directory of the source.
It is not intended to be a library imported by others and as such offers
no guarantees of API stability.
It makes heavy use of the ``mantidqt`` widgets collection and puts them
together to build the application shipped to users as ``MantidWorkbench``.
It is intended to be the main graphical interface provided by the project and
allows access to the customized interfaces as described in
`Container <container_>`_.

The application provides some widgets that are only applicable to itself,
such as the about screen, settings screen and project recovery mechanism that
is specific to workbench.

Plotting within ``workbench`` uses matplotlib_.
The application bundle provides some custom features to step in on the backend,
in ``workbench.plotting``, so that figures displayed within workbench offer
a richer experience than a standard matplotlib figure,
e.g. interactive fitting to data within a figure.
The aim of these customizations is to be transparent to a user in terms of the
matplotlib api.
A plotting script should function, without modification,
outside of workbench with the standard matplotlib backends,
including `Jupyter notebooks <jupyter_>`_,
only differing in how the final figure window is presented.
