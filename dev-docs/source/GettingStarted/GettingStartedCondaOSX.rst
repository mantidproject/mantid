.. _GettingStartedCondaOSX:

===========================
Develop with conda on MacOS
===========================

Install `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_
-------------------------------------
* On MacOS install using brew with the following command: ``brew install git``

.. include:: ./CloningMantid.rst

Install `Miniforge <https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Choose the latest version of ``Miniforge3-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`` for intel based Macs or for the new arm versions use ``Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh``
* Run your downloaded script from the terminal using ``bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`` or ``bash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh`` depending on your downloaded variant.
* If it asks whether or not you want to initialise conda with conda init, choose to do so.
* Restart your terminal.

Setup the mantid conda environment
----------------------------------
.. include:: ./MantidDeveloperSetup.rst

Configure CMake and generate build files
----------------------------------------
* Still using the terminal.
* If not already activated in the previous step, run ``conda activate mantid-developer`` to activate your conda environment.
* Navigate back to your mantid source directory using ``cd mantid`` if you used the default name during cloning from git.
* Inside of your mantid source directory run ``cmake --preset=osx``
    * Alternatively if you don't want to have your build folder in your mantid source then pass the ``-B`` argument, overriding the preset, to cmake: ``cmake {PATH_TO_SOURCE} --preset=osx -B {BUILD_DIR}``

How to build
-------------
* Navigate to the build directory.
* To build Mantid Workbench use: ``ninja``
* To build Unit Tests use: ``ninja AllTests``

CMake conda variables
-----------------------
The ``CONDA_BUILD`` parameter is used to customise our installation, which is required when we are using the conda-build tool to build and package Mantid.
This option can be passed to CMake on the command line using ``-DCONDA_BUILD=True``.

Running Workbench
-----------------

To run workbench from the commandline, ensure you conda environment is activated, and bin (in the build directory) is added to the python paths.

.. code:: sh

   export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:replace-with-full-file-path-to-bin"
   workbench

.. include:: ../macos-opengl-version-warning.txt
