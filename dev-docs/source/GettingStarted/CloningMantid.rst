Clone the mantid source code
----------------------------
* **Important**: If you have any existing non-conda mantid development environments, do not re-use the source and build directories for your conda environment.
  We recommend that you clone a new instance of the source and keep separate build directories to avoid any cmake configuration problems.
* Obtain the mantid source code by either:
    * Using git in a terminal and cloning the codebase by calling ``git clone git@github.com:mantidproject/mantid.git`` in the directory you want the code to clone to.
      You will need to follow this `Github guide <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh>`_ to configure SSH access.
      You may want to follow this `Git setup guide <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup>`_ to configure your git environment.
    * Or using `GitKraken <https://www.gitkraken.com/>`_.
