Release (technical tasks)
-------------------------

Once the unscripted testing has passed:

* Check the release notes and remove the "Under Construction" paragraph
  on the main index page.
* Disable release deploy jobs by executing
  `close-release-testing <http://builds.mantidproject.org/view/All/job/close-release-testing>`__
  job.
* On the ``release-next`` branch, update major & minor versions
  accordingly in ``buildconfig/CMake/VersionNumber.cmake``. Also
  uncomment ``VERSION_PATCH`` and set it to ``0``.
* Merge ``release-next`` branch back to ``master``
* Comment out patch number on ``master`` branch
* Draft a `new
  release <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/releases>`__ on
  GitHub. The new tag should be created based of the release branch in
  the form ``vX.Y.Z``
* Hit build on `release kit
  builds <http://builds.mantidproject.org/view/Release%20Pipeline/>`__
  and set the ``PACKAGE_SUFFIX`` parameter to an empty string
* After all of the packages have been smoke tested build the
  ``release_deploy`` job to put the packages (not windows) on
  Sourceforge.
* Kick off the build for ``mantidXY`` on RHEL7 for SNS:
  http://builds.mantidproject.org/job/release_clean-rhel7/ with suffix
  ``XY``
* Make sure someone at ISIS signs the Windows binary and uploads this
  manually to Sourceforge
* Set the default package for each OS to the new version
* Upload packages to GitHub once they are ready and have been checked
* Publish the page
* Update the `download <http://download.mantidproject.org>`__ page,
  following the instructions
  `here <https://github.com/mantidproject/download.mantidproject.org>`__
* Publish the draft release on GitHub (this will create the tag too).

Finalise
========

* Send an email, including the text of the release notes, to the
  following lists
* ``mantid-announce@mantidproject.org``
* ``mantid-developers@mantidproject.org``
* ``nobugs@nobugsconference.org``
* ``news@neutronsources.org``
* ``neutron@neutronsources.org``
* Create a new item on the forum news
* Close the release milestone in the issue tracker

Generate DOI (technical tasks)
------------------------------

This requires that a tag has been created for this release, this is done
automatically if a new
`release <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/releases>`__ has been
created on GitHub.

* Make sure that you have updated your local copy of git to grab the
  new tag. ``git fetch -p``
* If the script below fails you may need to update the authors list and
  push the updates to master. Look for ``authors.py`` in the
  ``tools/DOI`` directory. It does not matter that these are not on the
  release branch.

``python tools/DOI/doi.py  --username=_____  X.Y.Z``

* Major/minor/patch version numbers must be supplied, as well as a
  username which can be found in the `Protected
  Information <http://www.mantidproject.org/Protected_Information>`__
  section. The script will prompt for the password. Note that only
  MediaWiki admins have access rights to the page.
* A corresponding version tag must be present in the Mantid repo.

Next release plan
-----------------

* Prepare the Next release plan.
* Gather user descriptions of priority tickets from developers for the
  next release.
* Decide on priority maintenance tasks for the next release.
* Inject Items from the Facility scientific computing strategic plans.
* Compile to a document and release
